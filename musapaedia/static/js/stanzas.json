And Sir Robert put on a sudden resolution to solicit\r\nMr. Donne to be his companion in that journey. And this desire was\r\nsuddenly made known to his wife, who was then with child, and otherwise\r\nunder so dangerous a habit of body as to her health, that she professed\r\nan unwillingness to allow him any absence from her; saying, \"Her\r\ndivining soul boded her some ill in his absence;\" and therefore desired\r\nhim not to leave her. This made Mr. Donne lay aside all thoughts of the\r\njourney, and really to resolve against it. But Sir Robert became\r\nrestless in his persuasions for it, and Mr. Donne was so generous as to\r\nthink he had sold his liberty when he received so many charitable\r\nkindnesses from him, and told his wife so; who did therefore, with an\r\nunwilling willingness, give a faint consent to the journey, which was\r\nproposed to be but for two months; for about that time they determined\r\ntheir return. Within a few days after this resolve, the Ambassador, Sir\r\nRobert, and Mr. Donne, left London; and were the twelfth day got all\r\nsafe to Paris. Two days after their arrival there, Mr. Donne was left\r\nalone in that room in which Sir Robert, and he, and some other friends\r\nhad dined together. To this place Sir Robert returned within half an\r\nhour; and as he left, so he found, Mr. Donne alone; but in such an\r\necstasy, and so altered as to his looks, as amazed Sir Robert to behold\r\nhim; insomuch that he earnestly desired Mr. Donne to declare what had\r\nbefallen him in the short time of his absence. To which Mr. Donne was\r\nnot able to make a present answer; but, after a long and perplexed\r\npause, did at last say, \"I have seen a dreadful vision since I saw you:\r\nI have seen my dear wife pass twice by me through this room, with her\r\nhair hanging about her shoulders, and a dead child in her arms: this I\r\nhave seen since I saw you.\" To which Sir Robert replied, \"Sure, sir, you\r\nhave slept since I saw you; and this is the result of some melancholy\r\ndream, which I desire you to forget, for you are now awake.\" To which\r\nMr. Donne's reply was: \"I cannot be surer that I now live than that I\r\nhave not slept since I saw you: and am as sure that at her second\r\nappearing she stopped and looked me in the face, and vanished.\" Rest and\r\nsleep had not altered Mr. Donne's opinion the next day: for he then\r\naffirmed this vision with a more deliberate, and so confirmed a\r\nconfidence, that he inclined Sir Robert to a faint belief that the\r\nvision was true. It is truly said that desire and doubt have no rest;\r\nand it proved so with Sir Robert; for he immediately sent a servant to\r\nDrewry House, with a charge to hasten back and bring him word whether\r\nMrs. Donne were alive; and, if alive, in what condition she was as to\r\nher health. The twelfth day the messenger returned with this\r\naccount:--That he found and left Mrs. Donne very sad and sick in her\r\nbed; and that, after a long and dangerous labour, she had been delivered\r\nof a dead child. And, upon examination, the abortion proved to be the\r\nsame day, and about the very hour, that Mr. Donne affirmed he saw her\r\npass by him in his chamber.\r", "bookID": "23772"}, {"text": "This is a relation that will beget some wonder, and it well may; for\r\nmost of our world are at present possessed with an opinion that visions\r\nand miracles are ceased.

But if the unbelieving will not allow\r\nthe believing reader of this story, a liberty to believe that it may be\r\ntrue, then I wish him to consider many wise men have believed that the\r\nghost of Julius Caesar did appear to Brutus, and that both St. Austin,\r\nand Monica his mother, had visions in order to his conversion.

And the\r\nopinion that every man hath his particular angel may gain some authority\r\nby the relation of St. Peter's miraculous deliverance out of prison\r\n(Acts xii. 7-10; 13-15), not by many, but by one angel. And this belief\r\nmay yet gain more credit by the reader's considering, that when Peter\r\nafter his enlargement knocked at the door of Mary the mother of John,\r\nand Rhode, the maidservant, being surprised with joy that Peter was\r\nthere, did not let him in, but ran in haste and told the disciples, who\r\nwere then and there met together, that Peter was at the door; and they,\r\nnot believing it, said she was mad: yet, when she again affirmed it,\r\nthough they then believed it not, yet they concluded, and said, \"It is\r\nhis angel.\"\r", "bookID": "23772"}, {"text": "More observations of this nature, and inferences from them, might be\r\nmade to gain the relation a firmer belief; but I forbear, lest I, that\r\nintended to be but a relator, may be thought to be an engaged person for\r\nthe proving what was related to me; and yet I think myself bound to\r\ndeclare that, though it was not told me by Mr. Donne himself, it was\r\ntold me--now long since--by a person of honour, and of such intimacy\r\nwith him, that he knew more of the secrets of his soul than any person\r\nthen living: and I think he told me the truth; for it was told with such\r\ncircumstances, and such asseveration, that--to say nothing of my own\r\nthoughts--I verily believe he that told it me did himself believe it to\r\nbe true.\r", "bookID": "23772"}, {"text": "I return from my account of the vision, to tell the reader, that both\r\nbefore Mr. Donne's going into France, at his being there, and after his\r\nreturn, many of the nobility and others that were powerful at court,\r\nwere watchful and solicitous to the King for some secular employment for\r\nhim.

Call back\r\ntherefore thy meditation again, and bring it down: what's become of\r\nman's great extent and proportion, when himself shrinks himself and\r\nconsumes himself to a handful of dust; what's become of his soaring\r\nthoughts, his compassing thoughts, when himself brings himself to the\r\nignorance, to the thoughtlessness, of the grave? His diseases are his\r\nown, but the physician is not; he hath them at home, but he must send\r\nfor the physician.\r", "bookID": "23772"}, {"text": "I have not the righteousness of Job, but I have the desire of Job: _I\r\nwould speak to the Almighty, and I would reason with God_.[28] My God,\r\nmy God, how soon wouldst thou have me go to the physician, and how far\r\nwouldst thou have me go with the physician? I know thou hast made the\r\nmatter, and the man, and the art; and I go not from thee when I go to\r\nthe physician. Thou didst not make clothes before there was a shame of\r\nthe nakedness of the body, but thou didst make physic before there was\r\nany grudging of any sickness; for thou didst imprint a medicinal virtue\r\nin many simples, even from the beginning; didst thou mean that we should\r\nbe sick when thou didst so? when thou madest them? No more than thou\r\ndidst mean, that we should sin, when thou madest us: thou foresawest\r\nboth, but causedst neither. Thou, Lord, promisest here trees, _whose\r\nfruit shall be for meat, and their leaves for medicine_.[29] It is the\r\nvoice of thy Son, _Wilt thou be made whole?_[30] that draws from the\r\npatient a confession that he was ill, and could not make himself well.\r\nAnd it is thine own voice, _Is there no physician?_[31] that inclines\r\nus, disposes us, to accept thine ordinance. And it is the voice of the\r\nwise man, both for the matter, physic itself, _The Lord hath created\r\nmedicines out of the earth, and he that is wise shall not abhor\r\nthem_,[32] and for the art, and the person, the physician cutteth off a\r\nlong disease. In all these voices thou sendest us to those helps which\r\nthou hast afforded us in that. But wilt not thou avow that voice too,\r\n_He that hath sinned against his Maker, let him fall into the hands of\r\nthe physician_;[33] and wilt not thou afford me an understanding of\r\nthose words? Thou, who sendest us for a blessing to the physician, dost\r\nnot make it a curse to us to go when thou sendest. Is not the curse\r\nrather in this, that only he falls into the hands of the physician, that\r\ncasts himself wholly, entirely upon the physician, confides in him,\r\nrelies upon him, attends all from him, and neglects that spiritual\r\nphysic which thou also hast instituted in thy church. So to fall into\r\nthe hands of the physician is a sin, and a punishment of former sins;\r\nso, as Asa fell, who in his disease _sought not to the Lord, but to the\r\nphysician_.[34] Reveal therefore to me thy method, O Lord, and see\r\nwhether I have followed it; that thou mayest have glory, if I have, and\r\nI pardon, if I have not, and help that I may. Thy method is, _In time of\r\nthy sickness, be not negligent_: wherein wilt thou have my diligence\r\nexpressed? _Pray unto the Lord, and he will make thee whole._[35] O\r\nLord, I do; I pray, and pray thy servant David's prayer, _Have mercy\r\nupon me, O Lord, for I am weak; heal me, O Lord, for my bones are\r\nvexed_:[36] I know that even my weakness is a reason, a motive, to\r\ninduce thy mercy, and my sickness an occasion of thy sending health.\r\nWhen art thou so ready, when is it so seasonable to thee, to\r\ncommiserate, as in misery? But is prayer for health in season, as soon\r\nas I am sick? Thy method goes further: _Leave off from sin, and order\r\nthy hands aright, and cleanse thy heart from all wickedness_.[37] Have\r\nI, O Lord, done so? O Lord, I have; by thy grace, I am come to a holy\r\ndetestation of my former sin. Is there any more? In thy method there is\r\nmore: _Give a sweet savour, and a memorial of fine flour, and make a fat\r\noffering, as not being_.[38] And, Lord, by thy grace, I have done that,\r\nsacrificed a little of that little which thou lentest me, to them for\r\nwhom thou lentest it: and now in thy method, and by thy steps, I am come\r\nto that, _Then give place to the physician, for the Lord hath created\r\nhim; let him not go from thee, for thou hast need of him_.[39] I send\r\nfor the physician, but I will hear him enter with those words of Peter,\r\n_Jesus Christ maketh thee whole_;[40] I long for his presence, but I\r\nlook _that the power of the Lord should be present to heal me_.[41]\r", "bookID": "23772"}, {"text": "O most mighty and most merciful God, who art so the God of health and\r\nstrength, as that without thee all health is but the fuel, and all\r\nstrength but the bellows of sin; behold me under the vehemence of two\r\ndiseases, and under the necessity of two physicians, authorized by thee,\r\nthe bodily, and the spiritual physician. I come to both as to thine\r\nordinance, and bless and glorify thy name that, in both cases, thou hast\r\nafforded help to man by the ministry of man. Even in the new Jerusalem,\r\nin heaven itself, it hath pleased thee to discover a tree, which is _a\r\ntree of life there, but the leaves thereof are for the healing of the\r\nnations_.[42] Life itself is with thee there, for thou art life; and all\r\nkinds of health, wrought upon us here by thine instruments, descend from\r\nthence. _Thou wouldst have healed Babylon, but she is not healed._[43]\r\nTake from me, O Lord, her perverseness, her wilfulness, her\r\nrefractoriness, and hear thy Spirit saying in my soul: Heal me, O Lord,\r\nfor I would be healed. _Ephraim saw his sickness, and Judah his wound;\r\nthen went Ephraim to the Assyrian, and sent to King Jareb, yet could not\r\nhe heal you, nor cure you of your wound._[44] Keep me back, O Lord, from\r\nthem who misprofess arts of healing the soul, or of the body, by means\r\nnot imprinted by thee in the church for the soul, or not in nature for\r\nthe body. There is no spiritual health to be had by superstition, nor\r\nbodily by witchcraft; thou, Lord, and only thou, art Lord of both. Thou\r\nin thyself art Lord of both, and thou in thy Son art the physician, the\r\napplier of both. _With his stripes we are healed_,[45] says the prophet\r\nthere; there, before he was scourged, we were healed with his stripes;\r\nhow much more shall I be healed now, now when that which he hath already\r\nsuffered actually is actually and effectually applied to me? Is there\r\nany thing incurable, upon which that balm drops? Any vein so empty as\r\nthat that blood cannot fill it? Thou promisest to heal the earth;[46]\r\nbut it is when the inhabitants of the earth _pray that thou wouldst heal\r\nit_. Thou promisest to heal their waters, but _their miry places and\r\nstanding waters_, thou sayest there, _thou wilt not heal_.[47] My\r\nreturning to any sin, if I should return to the ability of sinning over\r\nall my sins again, thou wouldst not pardon. Heal this earth, O my God,\r\nby repentant tears, and heal these waters, these tears, from all\r\nbitterness, from all diffidence, from all dejection, by establishing my\r\nirremovable assurance in thee. _Thy Son went about healing all manner of\r\nsickness._[48] (No disease incurable, none difficult; he healed them in\r\npassing). _Virtue went out of him, and he healed all_,[49] all the\r\nmultitude (no person incurable), he healed them _every whit_[50] (as\r\nhimself speaks), he left no relics of the disease; and will this\r\nuniversal physician pass by this hospital, and not visit me? not heal\r\nme? not heal me wholly? Lord, I look not that thou shouldst say by thy\r\nmessenger to me, as to Hezekiah, _Behold, I will heal thee, and on the\r\nthird day thou shalt go up to the house of the Lord_.[51] I look not\r\nthat thou shouldst say to me, as to Moses in Miriam's behalf, when Moses\r\nwould have had her healed presently, _If her father had but spit in her\r\nface, should she not have been ashamed seven days? Let her be shut up\r\nseven days, and then return_;[52] but if thou be pleased to multiply\r\nseven days (and seven is infinite) by the number of my sins (and that is\r\nmore infinite), if this day must remove me till days shall be no more,\r\nseal to me my spiritual health, in affording me the seals of thy church;\r\nand for my temporal health, prosper thine ordinance, in their hands who\r\nshall assist in this sickness, in that manner, and in that measure, as\r\nmay most glorify thee, and most edify those who observe the issues of\r\nthy servants, to their own spiritual benefit.\r", "bookID": "23772"}, {"text": "As sickness is the greatest misery, so the greatest misery of sickness\r\nis solitude; when the infectiousness of the disease deters them who\r\nshould assist from coming; even the physician dares scarce come.\r\nSolitude is a torment which is not threatened in hell itself. Mere\r\nvacuity, the first agent, God, the first instrument of God, nature, will\r\nnot admit; nothing can be utterly empty, but so near a degree towards\r\nvacuity as solitude, to be but one, they love not. When I am dead, and\r\nmy body might infect, they have a remedy, they may bury me; but when I\r\nam but sick, and might infect, they have no remedy but their absence,\r\nand my solitude. It is an excuse to them that are great, and pretend,\r\nand yet are loath to come; it is an inhibition to those who would truly\r\ncome, because they may be made instruments, and pestiducts, to the\r\ninfection of others, by their coming. And it is an outlawry, an\r\nexcommunication upon the patient, and separates him from all offices,\r\nnot only of civility but of working charity. A long sickness will weary\r\nfriends at last, but a pestilential sickness averts them from the\r\nbeginning. God himself would admit a figure of society, as there is a\r\nplurality of persons in God, though there be but one God; and all his\r\nexternal actions testify a love of society, and communion. In heaven\r\nthere are orders of angels, and armies of martyrs, and in that house\r\nmany mansions; in earth, families, cities, churches, colleges, all\r\nplural things; and lest either of these should not be company enough\r\nalone, there is an association of both, a communion of saints which\r\nmakes the militant and triumphant church one parish; so that Christ was\r\nnot out of his diocess when he was upon the earth, nor out of his temple\r\nwhen he was in our flesh. God, who saw that all that he made was good,\r\ncame not so near seeing a defect in any of his works, as when he saw\r\nthat it was not good for man to be alone, therefore he made him a\r\nhelper; and one that should help him so as to increase the number, and\r\ngive him her own, and more society. Angels, who do not propagate nor\r\nmultiply, were made at first in an abundant number, and so were stars;\r\nbut for the things of this world, their blessing was, Increase; for I\r\nthink, I need not ask leave to think, that there is no phoenix;\r\nnothing singular, nothing alone. Men that inhere upon nature only, are\r\nso far from thinking that there is any thing singular in this world, as\r\nthat they will scarce think that this world itself is singular, but that\r\nevery planet, and every star, is another world like this; they find\r\nreason to conceive not only a plurality in every species in the world,\r\nbut a plurality of worlds; so that the abhorrers of solitude are not\r\nsolitary, for God, and Nature, and Reason concur against it. Now a man\r\nmay counterfeit the plague in a vow, and mistake a disease for religion,\r\nby such a retiring and recluding of himself from all men as to do good\r\nto no man, to converse with no man. God hath two testaments, two wills;\r\nbut this is a schedule, and not of his, a codicil, and not of his, not\r\nin the body of his testaments, but interlined and postscribed by others,\r\nthat the way to the communion of saints should be by such a solitude as\r\nexcludes all doing of good here. That is a disease of the mind, as the\r\nheight of an infectious disease of the body is solitude, to be left\r\nalone: for this makes an infectious bed equal, nay, worse than a grave,\r\nthat though in both I be equally alone, in my bed I know it, and feel\r\nit, and shall not in my grave: and this too, that in my bed my soul is\r\nstill in an infectious body, and shall not in my grave be so.\r", "bookID": "23772"}, {"text": "O God, my God, thy Son took it not ill at Martha's hands, that when he\r\nsaid unto her, _Thy brother Lazarus shall rise again_,[53] she\r\nexpostulated it so far with him as to reply, _I know that he shall rise\r\nagain in the resurrection, at the last day_; for she was miserable by\r\nwanting him then. Take it not ill, O my God, from me, that though thou\r\nhave ordained it for a blessing, and for a dignity to thy people, _that\r\nthey should dwell alone, and not be reckoned among the nations_[54]\r\n(because they should be above them), and that _they should dwell in\r\nsafety alone_[55] (free from the infestation of enemies), yet I take thy\r\nleave to remember thee, that thou hast said too, _Two are better than\r\none_; and, _Woe be unto him that is alone when he falleth_;[56] and so\r\nwhen he is fallen, and laid in the bed of sickness too. _Righteousness\r\nis immortal_;[57] I know thy wisdom hath said so; but no man, though\r\ncovered with the righteousness of thy Son, is immortal so as not to die;\r\nfor he who was righteousness itself did die.

Elias himself fainted under that apprehension, _Lo, I am left\r\nalone_;[63] and Martha murmured at that, said to Christ, _Lord, dost not\r\nthou care that my sister hath left me to serve alone?_[64] Neither could\r\nJeremiah enter into his lamentations from a higher ground than to say,\r\n_How doth the city sit solitary that was full of people_.[65] O my God,\r\nit is the leper that thou hast condemned to live alone;[66] have I such\r\na leprosy in my soul that I must die alone; alone without thee? Shall\r\nthis come to such a leprosy in my body that I must die alone; alone\r\nwithout them that should assist, that should comfort me? But comes not\r\nthis expostulation too near a murmuring?

As the\r\nill affections of the spleen complicate and mingle themselves with every\r\ninfirmity of the body, so doth fear insinuate itself in every action or\r\npassion of the mind; and as wind in the body will counterfeit any\r\ndisease, and seem the stone, and seem the gout, so fear will counterfeit\r\nany disease of the mind. It shall seem love, a love of having; and it is\r\nbut a fear, a jealous and suspicious fear of losing. It shall seem\r\nvalour in despising and undervaluing danger; and it is but fear in an\r\novervaluing of opinion and estimation, and a fear of losing that.

My weakness is from nature, who hath but her measure; my strength\r\nis from God, who possesses and distributes infinitely.

I must then speak to thee at all\r\ntimes, but when must I fear thee? At all times too. When didst thou\r\nrebuke any petitioner with the name of importunate? Thou hast proposed\r\nto us a parable of a judge[72] that did justice at last, because the\r\nclient was importunate, and troubled him; but thou hast told us plainly,\r\nthat thy use in that parable was not that thou wast troubled with our\r\nimportunities, but (as thou sayest there) _that we should always pray_.\r\nAnd to the same purpose thou proposest another,[73] that if I press my\r\nfriend, when he is in bed at midnight, to lend me bread, though he will\r\nnot rise because I am his friend, yet because of mine importunity he\r\nwill. God will do this whensoever thou askest, and never call it\r\nimportunity. Pray in thy bed at midnight, and God will not say, I will\r\nhear thee to-morrow upon thy knees, at thy bedside; pray upon thy knees\r\nthere then, and God will not say, I will hear thee on Sunday at church;\r\nGod is no dilatory God, no froward God; prayer is never unseasonable,\r\nGod is never asleep, nor absent. But, O my God, can I do this, and fear\r\nthee; come to thee and speak to thee, in all places, at all hours, and\r\nfear thee? Dare I ask this question? There is more boldness in the\r\nquestion than in the coming; I may do it though I fear thee; I cannot do\r\nit except I fear thee. So well hast thou provided that we should always\r\nfear thee, as that thou hast provided that we should fear no person but\r\nthee, nothing but thee; no men? No. Whom? _The Lord is my help and my\r\nsalvation, whom shall I fear?_[74] Great enemies?

Why should we fear\r\nthem? But for all this metaphorical bread, victory over enemies that\r\nthought to devour us, may we not fear, that we may lack bread literally?\r\nAnd fear famine, though we fear not enemies? _Young lions do lack and\r\nsuffer hunger, but they that seek the Lord shall not want any good\r\nthing._[76] Never? Though it be well with them at one time, may they not\r\nfear that it may be worse? _Wherefore should I fear in the days of\r\nevil?_[77] says thy servant David. Though his own sin had made them\r\nevil, he feared them not. No? not if this evil determine in death? Not\r\nthough in a death; not though in a death inflicted by violence, by\r\nmalice, by our own desert; _fear not the sentence of death_,[78] if thou\r\nfear God. Thou art, O my God, so far from admitting us that fear thee to\r\nfear others, as that thou makest others to fear us; as _Herod feared\r\nJohn, because he was a holy and a just man, and observed him_.[79] How\r\nfully then, O my abundant God, how gently, O my sweet, my easy God, dost\r\nthou unentangle me in any scruple arising out of the consideration of\r\nthy fear! Is not this that which thou intendest when thou sayest, _The\r\nsecret of the Lord is with them that fear him_;[80] the secret, the\r\nmystery of the right use of fear. Dost thou not mean this when thou\r\nsayest, _we shall understand the fear of the Lord_?[81] Have it, and\r\nhave benefit by it; have it, and stand under it; be directed by it, and\r\nnot be dejected with it. And dost thou not propose that church for our\r\nexample when thou sayest, the church of Judea _walked in the fear of\r\nGod_;[82] they had it, but did not sit down lazily, nor fall down\r\nweakly, nor sink under it. There is a fear which weakens men in the\r\nservice of God. _Adam was afraid, because he was naked._[83] They who\r\nhave put off thee are a prey to all. They may fear, for _Thou wilt laugh\r\nwhen their fear comes upon them_, as thou hast told them more than\r\nonce.[84] And thou wilt make them fear where no cause of fear is, as\r\nthou hast told them more than once too.[85] There is a fear that is a\r\npunishment of former wickednesses, and induces more. Though some said of\r\nthy Son, Christ Jesus, _that he was a good man, yet no man spake openly\r\nfor fear of the Jews_. Joseph was his disciple, _but secretly, for fear\r\nof the Jews_.[86] The disciples kept some meetings, but with doors shut\r\nfor fear of the Jews. O my God, thou givest us fear for ballast to carry\r\nus steadily in all weathers. But thou wouldst ballast us with such sand\r\nas should have gold in it, with that fear which is thy fear; for _the\r\nfear of the Lord is his treasure_.[87] He that hath that lacks nothing\r\nthat man can have, nothing that God does give. Timorous men thou\r\nrebukest: _Why are ye fearful, O ye of little faith?_[88] Such thou\r\ndismissest from thy service with scorn, though of them there went from\r\nGideon's army twenty-two thousand, and remained but ten thousand.[89]\r\nSuch thou sendest farther than so; thither from whence they never\r\nreturn: _The fearful and the unbelieving, into that burning lake which\r\nis the second death_.[90] There is a fear and there is a hope, which are\r\nequal abominations to thee; for, they were confounded because they\r\nhoped,[91] says thy servant Job; because they had misplaced, miscentred\r\ntheir hopes, they hoped, and not in thee, and such shall fear, and not\r\nfear thee. But in thy fear, my God, and my fear, my God, and my hope, is\r\nhope, and love, and confidence, and peace, and every limb and ingredient\r\nof happiness enwrapped; for joy includes all, and fear and joy consist\r\ntogether, nay, constitute one another. _The women departed from the\r\nsepulchre_,[92] the women who were made supernumerary apostles, apostles\r\nto the apostles; mothers of the church, and of the fathers, grandfathers\r\nof the church, the apostles themselves; the women, angels of the\r\nresurrection, went from the sepulchre with fear and joy; they ran, says\r\nthe text, and they ran upon those two legs, fear and joy; and both was\r\nthe right leg; they joy in thee, O Lord, that fear thee, and fear thee\r\nonly, who feel this joy in thee. Nay, thy fear, and thy love are\r\ninseparable; still we are called upon, in infinite places, to fear God,\r\nyet the commandment, which is the root of all is, Thou shalt love the\r\nLord thy God; he doeth neither that doeth not both; he omits neither,\r\nthat does one. Therefore when thy servant David had said that _the fear\r\nof the Lord is the beginning of wisdom_,[93] and his son had repeated it\r\nagain,[94] he that collects both calls this fear the root of wisdom;\r\nand, that it may embrace all, he calls it wisdom itself.[95] A wise man,\r\ntherefore, is never without it, never without the exercise of it;\r\ntherefore thou sentest Moses to thy people, _that they might learn to\r\nfear thee all the days of their lives_,[96] not in heavy and calamitous,\r\nbut in good and cheerful days too; for Noah, who had assurance of his\r\ndeliverance, yet, _moved with fear, prepared an ark, for the saving of\r\nhis house_.[97] _A wise man will fear in everything._[98] And therefore,\r\nthough I pretend to no other degree of wisdom, I am abundantly rich in\r\nthis, that I lie here possessed with that fear which is thy fear, both\r\nthat this sickness is thy immediate correction, and not merely a natural\r\naccident, and therefore fearful, because it is a fearful thing to fall\r\ninto thy hands; and that this fear preserves me from all inordinate\r\nfear, arising out of the infirmity of nature, because thy hand being\r\nupon me, thou wilt never let me fall out of thy hand.\r", "bookID": "23772"}, {"text": "O most mighty God, and merciful God, the God of all true sorrow, and\r\ntrue joy too, of all fear, and of all hope too, as thou hast given me a\r\nrepentance, not to be repented of, so give me, O Lord, a fear, of which\r\nI may not be afraid. Give me tender and supple and conformable\r\naffections, that as I joy with them that joy, and mourn with them that\r\nmourn, so I may fear with them that fear. And since thou hast vouchsafed\r\nto discover to me, in his fear whom thou hast admitted to be my\r\nassistance in this sickness, that there is danger therein, let me not, O\r\nLord, go about to overcome the sense of that fear, so far as to\r\npretermit the fitting and preparing of myself for the worst that may be\r\nfeared, the passage out of this life. Many of thy blessed martyrs have\r\npassed out of this life without any show of fear; but thy most blessed\r\nSon himself did not so. Thy martyrs were known to be but men, and\r\ntherefore it pleased thee to fill them with thy Spirit and thy power, in\r\nthat they did more than men; thy Son was declared by thee, and by\r\nhimself, to be God; and it was requisite that he should declare himself\r\nto be man also, in the weaknesses of man. Let me not therefore, O my\r\nGod, be ashamed of these fears, but let me feel them to determine where\r\nhis fear did, in a present submitting of all to thy will. And when thou\r\nshalt have inflamed and thawed my former coldnesses and indevotions with\r\nthese heats, and quenched my former heats with these sweats and\r\ninundations, and rectified my former presumptions and negligences with\r\nthese fears, be pleased, O Lord, as one made so by thee, to think me fit\r\nfor thee; and whether it be thy pleasure to dispose of this body, this\r\ngarment, so as to put it to a farther wearing in this world, or to lay\r\nit up in the common wardrobe, the grave, for the next, glorify thyself\r\nin thy choice now, and glorify it then, with that glory, which thy Son,\r\nour Saviour Christ Jesus, hath purchased for them whom thou makest\r\npartakers of his resurrection.

Howsoever, his desiring of others\r\nargues his candour, and his ingenuity; if the danger be great, he\r\njustifies his proceedings, and he disguises nothing that calls in\r\nwitnesses; and if the danger be not great, he is not ambitious, that is\r\nso ready to divide the thanks and the honour of that work which he begun\r\nalone, with others. It diminishes not the dignity of a monarch that he\r\nderive part of his care upon others; God hath not made many suns, but he\r\nhath made many bodies that receive and give light. The Romans began with\r\none king; they came to two consuls; they returned in extremities to one\r\ndictator: whether in one or many, the sovereignty is the same in all\r\nstates and the danger is not the more, and the providence is the more,\r\nwhere there are more physicians; as the state is the happier where\r\nbusinesses are carried by more counsels than can be in one breast, how\r\nlarge soever. Diseases themselves hold consultations, and conspire how\r\nthey may multiply, and join with one another, and exalt one another's\r\nforce so; and shall we not call physicians to consultations? Death is in\r\nan old man's door, he appears and tells him so, and death is at a young\r\nman's back, and says nothing; age is a sickness, and youth is an\r\nambush; and we need so many physicians as may make up a watch, and spy\r\nevery inconvenience. There is scarce any thing that hath not killed\r\nsomebody; a hair, a feather hath done it; nay, that which is our best\r\nantidote against it hath done it; the best cordial hath been deadly\r\npoison. Men have died of joy, and almost forbidden their friends to weep\r\nfor them, when they have seen them die laughing. Even that tyrant,\r\nDionysius (I think the same that suffered so much after), who could not\r\ndie of that sorrow, of that high fall, from a king to a wretched private\r\nman, died of so poor a joy as to be declared by the people at a theatre\r\nthat he was a good poet. We say often that a man may live of a little;\r\nbut, alas, of how much less may a man die? And therefore the more\r\nassistants the better. Who comes to a day of hearing, in a cause of any\r\nimportance, with one advocate? In our funerals we ourselves have no\r\ninterest; there we cannot advise, we cannot direct; and though some\r\nnations (the Egyptians in particular) built themselves better tombs than\r\nhouses because they were to dwell longer in them, yet amongst ourselves,\r\nthe greatest man of style whom we have had, the Conqueror, was left, as\r\nsoon as his soul left him, not only without persons to assist at his\r\ngrave but without a grave. Who will keep us then we know not; as long as\r\nwe can, let us admit as much help as we can; another and another\r\nphysician is not another and another indication and symptom of death,\r\nbut another and another assistant, and proctor of life: nor do they so\r\nmuch feed the imagination with apprehension of danger, as the\r\nunderstanding with comfort. Let not one bring learning, another\r\ndiligence, another religion, but every one bring all; and as many\r\ningredients enter into a receipt, so may many men make the receipt. But\r\nwhy do I exercise my meditation so long upon this, of having plentiful\r\nhelp in time of need? Is not my meditation rather to be inclined another\r\nway, to condole and commiserate their distress who have none? How many\r\nare sicker (perchance) than I, and laid in their woful straw at home (if\r\nthat corner be a home), and have no more hope of help, though they die,\r\nthan of preferment, though they live! Nor do more expect to see a\r\nphysician then, than to be an officer after; of whom, the first that\r\ntakes knowledge, is the sexton that buries them, who buries them in\r\noblivion too! For they do but fill up the number of the dead in the\r\nbill, but we shall never hear their names, till we read them in the book\r\nof life with our own. How many are sicker (perchance) than I, and thrown\r\ninto hospitals, where (as a fish left upon the sand must stay the tide)\r\nthey must stay the physician's hour of visiting, and then can be but\r\nvisited! How many are sicker (perchance) than all we, and have not this\r\nhospital to cover them, not this straw to lie in, to die in, but have\r\ntheir gravestone under them, and breathe out their souls in the ears and\r\nin the eyes of passengers, harder than their bed, the flint of the\r\nstreet? that taste of no part of our physic, but a sparing diet, to whom\r\nordinary porridge would be julep enough, the refuse of our servants\r\nbezoar enough, and the offscouring of our kitchen tables cordial enough.\r\nO my soul, when thou art not enough awake to bless thy God enough for\r\nhis plentiful mercy in affording thee many helpers, remember how many\r\nlack them, and help them to them or to those other things which they\r\nlack as much as them.\r", "bookID": "23772"}, {"text": "My God, my God, thy blessed servant Augustine begged of thee that Moses\r\nmight come and tell him what he meant by some places of Genesis: may I\r\nhave leave to ask of that Spirit that writ that book, why, when David\r\nexpected news from Joab's army,[99] and that the watchman told him that\r\nhe saw a man running alone, David concluded out of that circumstance,\r\nthat if he came alone, he brought good news?[100] I see the grammar, the\r\nword signifies so, and is so ever accepted, _good news_; but I see not\r\nthe logic nor the rhetoric, how David would prove or persuade that his\r\nnews was good because he was alone, except a greater company might have\r\nmade great impressions of danger, by imploring and importuning present\r\nsupplies. Howsoever that be, I am sure that that which thy apostle says\r\nto Timothy, _Only Luke is with me_,[101] Luke, and nobody but Luke, hath\r\na taste of complaint and sorrow in it: though Luke want no testimony of\r\nability, of forwardness, of constancy, and perseverance, in assisting\r\nthat great building which St. Paul laboured in, yet St. Paul is affected\r\nwith that, that there was none but Luke to assist. We take St. Luke to\r\nhave been a physician, and it admits the application the better that in\r\nthe presence of one good physician we may be glad of more. It was not\r\nonly a civil spirit of policy, or order, that moved Moses's\r\nfather-in-law to persuade him to divide the burden of government and\r\njudicature with others, and take others to his assistance,[102] but it\r\nwas also thy immediate Spirit, O my God, that moved Moses to present\r\nunto thee seventy of the elders of Israel,[103] to receive of that\r\nSpirit, which was upon Moses only before, such a portion as might ease\r\nhim in the government of that people; though Moses alone had endowments\r\nabove all, thou gavest him other assistants. I consider thy plentiful\r\ngoodness, O my God, in employing angels more than one in so many of thy\r\nremarkable works. Of thy Son, thou sayest, _Let all the angels of God\r\nworship him_;[104] if that be in heaven, upon earth he says, _that he\r\ncould command twelve legions of angels_;[105] and when heaven and earth\r\nshall be all one, at the last day, thy Son, O God, _the Son of man,\r\nshall come in his glory, and all the holy angels with him_.[106] The\r\nangels that celebrated his birth to the shepherds,[107] the angels that\r\ncelebrated his second birth, his resurrection, to the Maries,[108] were\r\nin the plural, angels associated with angels. In Jacob's ladder,[109]\r\nthey who ascended and descended, and maintained the trade between heaven\r\nand earth, between thee and us, they who have the commission, and charge\r\nto guide us in all our ways,[110] they who hastened Lot,[111] and in\r\nhim, us, from places of danger and temptation, they who are appointed to\r\ninstruct and govern us in the church here,[112] they who are sent to\r\npunish the disobedient and refractory,[113] that they are to be mowers\r\nand harvestmen[114] after we are grown up in one field, the church, at\r\nthe day of judgment, they that are to carry our souls whither they\r\ncarried Lazarus,[115] they who attended at the several gates of the new\r\nJerusalem,[116] to admit us there; all these who administer to thy\r\nservants, from the first to their last, are angels, angels in the\r\nplural, in every service angels associated with angels. The power of a\r\nsingle angel we see in that one, who in one night destroyed almost two\r\nhundred thousand in Sennacherib's army,[117] yet thou often employest\r\nmany; as we know the power of salvation is abundantly in any one\r\nevangelist, and yet thou hast afforded us four. Thy Son proclaims of\r\nhimself that _the Spirit hath anointed him to preach the Gospel_,[118]\r\nyet he hath given others _for the perfecting of the saints in the work\r\nof the ministry_.[119] Thou hast made him _Bishop of our souls_,[120]\r\nbut there are others bishops too.

Let him be a world, and himself will be the land, and\r\nmisery the sea. His misery (for misery is his, his own; of the happiness\r\neven of this world, he is but tenant, but of misery the freeholder; of\r\nhappiness he is but the farmer, but the usufructuary, but of misery the\r\nlord, the proprietary), his misery, as the sea, swells above all the\r\nhills, and reaches to the remotest parts of this earth, man; who of\r\nhimself is but dust, and coagulated and kneaded into earth by tears; his\r\nmatter is earth, his form misery. In this world that is mankind, the\r\nhighest ground, the eminentest hills, are kings; and have they line and\r\nlead enough to fathom this sea, and say, My misery is but this deep?\r\nScarce any misery equal to sickness, and they are subject to that\r\nequally with their lowest subject. A glass is not the less brittle,\r\nbecause a king's face is represented in it; nor a king the less brittle,\r\nbecause God is represented in him. They have physicians continually\r\nabout them, and therefore sickness, or the worst of sicknesses,\r\ncontinual fear of it. Are they gods? He that called them so cannot\r\nflatter. They are gods, but sick gods; and God is presented to us under\r\nmany human affections, as far as infirmities: God is called angry, and\r\nsorry, and weary, and heavy, but never a sick God; for then he might die\r\nlike men, as our gods do. The worst that they could say in reproach and\r\nscorn of the gods of the heathen was, that perchance they were asleep;\r\nbut gods that are so sick as that they cannot sleep are in an infirmer\r\ncondition. A god, and need a physician? A Jupiter, and need an\r\nAEsculapius? that must have rhubarb to purge his choler lest he be too\r\nangry, and agarick to purge his phlegm lest he be too drowsy; that as\r\nTertullian says of the Egyptian gods, plants and herbs, that \"God was\r\nbeholden to man for growing in his garden,\" so we must say of these\r\ngods, their eternity (an eternity of threescore and ten years) is in the\r\napothecary's shop, and not in the metaphorical deity. But their deity is\r\nbetter expressed in their humility than in their height; when abounding\r\nand overflowing, as God, in means of doing good, they descend, as God,\r\nto a communication of their abundances with men according to their\r\nnecessities, then they are gods. No man is well that understands not,\r\nthat values not his being well; that hath not a cheerfulness and a joy\r\nin it; and whosoever hath this joy hath a desire to communicate, to\r\npropagate that which occasions his happiness and his joy to others; for\r\nevery man loves witnesses of his happiness, and the best witnesses are\r\nexperimental witnesses; they who have tasted of that in themselves which\r\nmakes us happy.

And if he stumble, they will help to overthrow\r\nhim._[122] Therefore may my words be undervalued and my errors\r\naggravated, if I offer to speak of kings; but not by thee, O my God,\r\nbecause I speak of them as they are in thee, and of thee as thou art in\r\nthem. Certainly those men prepare a way of speaking negligently or\r\nirreverently of thee, that give themselves that liberty in speaking of\r\nthy vicegerents, kings; for thou who gavest Augustus the empire, gavest\r\nit to Nero too; and as Vespasian had it from thee, so had Julian. Though\r\nkings deface in themselves thy first image in their own soul, thou\r\ngivest no man leave to deface thy second image, imprinted indelibly in\r\ntheir power. But thou knowest, O God, that if I should be slack in\r\ncelebrating thy mercies to me exhibited by that royal instrument, my\r\nsovereign, to many other faults that touch upon allegiance I should add\r\nthe worst of all, ingratitude, which constitutes an ill man; and faults\r\nwhich are defects in any particular function are not so great as those\r\nthat destroy our humanity. It is not so ill to be an ill subject as to\r\nbe an ill man; for he hath an universal illness, ready to flow and pour\r\nout itself into any mould, any form, and to spend itself in any\r\nfunction. As therefore thy Son did upon the coin, I look upon the king,\r\nand I ask whose image and whose inscription he hath, and he hath thine;\r\nand I give unto thee that which is thine; I recommend his happiness to\r\nthee in all my sacrifices of thanks, for that which he enjoys, and in\r\nall my prayers for the continuance and enlargement of them. But let me\r\nstop, my God, and consider; will not this look like a piece of art and\r\ncunning, to convey into the world an opinion that I were more particular\r\nin his care than other men? and that herein, in a show of humility and\r\nthankfulness, I magnify myself more than there is cause? But let not\r\nthat jealousy stop me, O God, but let me go forward in celebrating thy\r\nmercy exhibited by him. This which he doth now, in assisting so my\r\nbodily health, I know is common to me with many: many, many have tasted\r\nof that expression of his graciousness. Where he can give health by his\r\nown hands he doth, and to more than any of his predecessors have done:\r\ntherefore hath God reserved one disease for him, that he only might cure\r\nit, though perchance not only by one title and interest, nor only as one\r\nking. To those that need it not, in that kind, and so cannot have it by\r\nhis own hand, he sends a donative of health in sending his physician.\r\nThe holy king St. Louis, in France, and our Maud, is celebrated for\r\nthat, that personally they visited hospitals, and assisted in the cure\r\neven of loathsome diseases. And when that religious Empress Placilla,\r\nthe wife of Theodosius, was told that she diminished herself too much in\r\nthose personal assistances and might do enough in sending relief, she\r\nsaid she would send in that capacity as a Christian, as a fellow-member\r\nof the body of thy Son, with them. So thy servant David applies himself\r\nto his people, so he incorporates himself in his people, by calling them\r\nhis brethren, his bones, his flesh;[123] and when they fell under thy\r\nhand, even to the pretermitting of himself, he presses upon thee by\r\nprayer for them; _I have sinned, but these sheep, what have they done?\r\nLet thine hand, I pray thee, be against me and against my father's\r\nhouse_.[124] It is kingly to give; when Araunah gave that great and free\r\npresent to David, that place, those instruments for sacrifice, and the\r\nsacrifices themselves, it is said there by thy Spirit, _All these things\r\ndid Araunah give, as a king, to the king_.[125] To give is an\r\napproaching to the condition of kings, but to give health, an\r\napproaching to the King of kings, to thee. But this his assisting to my\r\nbodily health, thou knowest, O God, and so do some others of thine\r\nhonourable servants know, is but the twilight of that day wherein thou,\r\nthrough him, hast shined upon me before; but the echo of that voice,\r\nwhereby thou, through him, hast spoke to me before, then when he, first\r\nof any man, conceived a hope that I might be of some use in thy church\r\nand descended to an intimation, to a persuasion, almost to a\r\nsolicitation, that I would embrace that calling. And thou who hadst put\r\nthat desire into his heart, didst also put into mine an obedience to it;\r\nand I, who was sick before of a vertiginous giddiness and irresolution,\r\nand almost spent all my time in consulting how I should spend it, was by\r\nthis man of God, and God of men, put into the pool and recovered: when I\r\nasked, perchance, a stone, he gave me bread; when I asked, perchance, a\r\nscorpion, he gave me a fish; when I asked a temporal office, he denied\r\nnot, refused not that; but let me see that he had rather I took this.\r\nThese things thou, O God, who forgettest nothing, hast not forgot,\r\nthough perchance he, because they were benefits, hath; but I am not only\r\na witness, but an instance, that our Jehoshaphat hath a care to ordain\r\npriests, as well as judges:[126] and not only to send physicians for\r\ntemporal but to be the physician for spiritual health.\r", "bookID": "23772"}, {"text": "O eternal and most gracious God, who, though thou have reserved thy\r\ntreasure of perfect joy and perfect glory to be given by thine own hands\r\nthen, when, by seeing thee as thou art in thyself, and knowing thee as\r\nwe are known, we shall possess in an instant, and possess for ever, all\r\nthat can any way conduce to our happiness, yet here also, in this world,\r\ngivest us such earnests of that full payment, as by the value of the\r\nearnest we may give some estimate of the treasure, humbly and thankfully\r\nI acknowledge, that thy blessed Spirit instructs me to make a difference\r\nof thy blessings in this world, by that difference of the instruments by\r\nwhich it hath pleased thee to derive them unto me.

O how manifold and perplexed a thing,\r\nnay, how wanton and various a thing, is ruin and destruction! God\r\npresented to David three kinds, war, famine and pestilence; Satan left\r\nout these, and brought in fires from heaven and winds from the\r\nwilderness. If there were no ruin but sickness, we see the masters of\r\nthat art can scarce number, not name all sicknesses; every thing that\r\ndisorders a faculty, and the function of that, is a sickness; the names\r\nwill not serve them which are given from the place affected, the\r\npleurisy is so; nor from the effect which it works, the falling sickness\r\nis so; they cannot have names enough, from what it does, nor where it\r\nis, but they must extort names from what it is like, what it resembles,\r\nand but in some one thing, or else they would lack names; for the wolf,\r\nand the canker, and the polypus are so; and that question whether there\r\nbe more names or things, is as perplexed in sicknesses as in any thing\r\nelse; except it be easily resolved upon that side that there are more\r\nsicknesses than names. If ruin were reduced to that one way, that man\r\ncould perish no way but by sickness, yet his danger were infinite; and\r\nif sickness were reduced to that one way, that there were no sickness\r\nbut a fever, yet the way were infinite still; for it would overload and\r\noppress any natural, disorder and discompose any artificial, memory, to\r\ndeliver the names of several fevers; how intricate a work then have they\r\nwho are gone to consult which of these sicknesses mine is, and then\r\nwhich of these fevers, and then what it would do, and then how it may be\r\ncountermined. But even in ill it is a degree of good when the evil will\r\nadmit consultation. In many diseases, that which is but an accident, but\r\na symptom of the main disease, is so violent, that the physician must\r\nattend the cure of that, though he pretermit (so far as to intermit) the\r\ncure of the disease itself. Is it not so in states too? Sometimes the\r\ninsolency of those that are great puts the people into commotions; the\r\ngreat disease, and the greatest danger to the head, is the insolency of\r\nthe great ones; and yet they execute martial law, they come to present\r\nexecutions upon the people, whose commotion was indeed but a symptom,\r\nbut an accident of the main disease; but this symptom, grown so violent,\r\nwould allow no time for a consultation. Is it not so in the accidents of\r\nthe diseases of our mind too? Is it not evidently so in our affections,\r\nin our passions? If a choleric man be ready to strike, must I go about\r\nto purge his choler, or to break the blow? But where there is room for\r\nconsultation things are not desperate. They consult, so there is nothing\r\nrashly, inconsiderately done; and then they prescribe, they write, so\r\nthere is nothing covertly, disguisedly, unavowedly done. In bodily\r\ndiseases it is not always so; sometimes, as soon as the physician's foot\r\nis in the chamber, his knife is in the patient's arm; the disease would\r\nnot allow a minute's forbearing of blood, nor prescribing of other\r\nremedies. In states and matter of government it is so too; they are\r\nsometimes surprised with such accidents, as that the magistrate asks not\r\nwhat may be done by law, but does that which must necessarily be done in\r\nthat case. But it is a degree of good in evil, a degree that carries\r\nhope and comfort in it, when we may have recourse to that which is\r\nwritten, and that the proceedings may be apert, and ingenuous, and\r\ncandid, and avowable, for that gives satisfaction and acquiescence. They\r\nwho have received my anatomy of myself consult, and end their\r\nconsultation in prescribing, and in prescribing physic; proper and\r\nconvenient remedy; for if they should come in again and chide me for\r\nsome disorder that had occasioned and induced, or that had hastened and\r\nexalted this sickness, or if they should begin to write now rules for my\r\ndiet and exercise when I were well, this were to antedate or to postdate\r\ntheir consultation, not to give physic. It were rather a vexation than a\r\nrelief, to tell a condemned prisoner, You might have lived if you had\r\ndone this; and if you can get your pardon, you shall do well to take\r\nthis or this course hereafter. I am glad they know (I have hid nothing\r\nfrom them), glad they consult (they hid nothing from one another), glad\r\nthey write (they hide nothing from the world), glad that they write and\r\nprescribe physic, that there are remedies for the present case.\r", "bookID": "23772"}, {"text": "My God, my God, allow me a just indignation, a holy detestation of the\r\ninsolency of that man who, because he was of that high rank, of whom\r\nthou hast said, _They are gods_, thought himself more than equal to\r\nthee; that king of Aragon, Alphonsus, so perfect in the motions of the\r\nheavenly bodies as that he adventured to say, that if he had been of\r\ncounsel with thee, in the making of the heavens, the heavens should have\r\nbeen disposed in a better order than they are. The king Amaziah would\r\nnot endure thy prophet to reprehend him, but asked him in anger, _Art\r\nthou made of the king's counsel?_[127] When thy prophet Esaias asks that\r\nquestion, _Who hath directed the spirit of the Lord, or being his\r\ncounsellor, hath taught him?_[128] it is after he had settled and\r\ndetermined that office upon thy Son, and him only, when he joins with\r\nthose great titles, the mighty God and the Prince of peace, this also,\r\nthe Counsellor;[129] and after he had settled upon him the spirit of\r\nmight and of counsel.[130] So that then thou, O God, though thou have no\r\ncounsel from man, yet dost nothing upon man without counsel. In the\r\nmaking of man there was a consultation; _Let us make man_.[131] In the\r\npreserving of man, _O thou great Preserver of men_,[132] thou proceedest\r\nby counsel; for all thy external works are the works of the whole\r\nTrinity, and their hand is to every action.

I offer not to counsel them who meet in\r\nconsultation for my body now, but I open my infirmities, I anatomize my\r\nbody to them.

From thy first book, the book of life, never shut to thee, but\r\nnever thoroughly open to us; from thy second book, the book of nature,\r\nwhere, though subobscurely and in shadows, thou hast expressed thine own\r\nimage; from thy third book, the Scriptures, where thou hadst written all\r\nin the Old, and then lightedst us a candle to read it by, in the New,\r\nTestament; to these thou hadst added the book of just and useful laws,\r\nestablished by them to whom thou hast committed thy people; to those,\r\nthe manuals, the pocket, the bosom books of our own consciences; to\r\nthose thy particular books of all our particular sins; and to those, the\r\nbooks with seven seals, which only _the Lamb which was slain, was found\r\nworthy to open_;[134] which, I hope, it shall not disagree with the\r\nmeaning of thy blessed Spirit to interpret the promulgation of their\r\npardon and righteousness who are washed in the blood of that Lamb; and\r\nif thou refer me to these books, to a new reading, a new trial by these\r\nbooks, this fever may be but a burning in the hand and I may be saved,\r\nthough not by my book, mine own conscience, nor by thy other books, yet\r\nby thy first, the book of life, thy decree for my election, and by thy\r\nlast, the book of the Lamb, and the shedding of his blood upon me. If I\r\nbe still under consultation, I am not condemned yet; if I be sent to\r\nthese books, I shall not be condemned at all; for though there be\r\nsomething written in some of those books (particularly in the\r\nScriptures) which some men turn to poison, yet upon these consultations\r\n(these confessions, these takings of our particular cases into thy\r\nconsideration) thou intendest all for physic; and even from those\r\nsentences from which a too late repenter will suck desperation, he that\r\nseeks thee early shall receive thy morning dew, thy seasonable mercy,\r\nthy forward consolation.\r", "bookID": "23772"}, {"text": "O eternal and most gracious God, who art of so pure eyes as that thou\r\ncanst not look upon sin, and we of so unpure constitutions as that we\r\ncan present no object but sin, and therefore might justly fear that\r\nthou wouldst turn thine eyes for ever from us, as, though we cannot\r\nendure afflictions in ourselves, yet in thee we can; so, though thou\r\ncanst not endure sin in us, yet in thy Son thou canst, and he hath taken\r\nupon himself, and presented to thee, all those sins which might\r\ndisplease thee in us.

In all these (the frame of the heavens, the states\r\nupon earth, and men in them, comprehend all), those are the greatest\r\nmischiefs which are least discerned; the most insensible in their ways\r\ncome to be the most sensible in their ends. The heavens have had their\r\ndropsy, they drowned the world; and they shall have their fever, and\r\nburn the world.

Though the dogstar have a pestilent breath,\r\nan infectious exhalation, yet, because we know when it will rise, we\r\nclothe ourselves, and we diet ourselves, and we shadow ourselves to a\r\nsufficient prevention; but comets and blazing stars, whose effects or\r\nsignifications no man can interrupt or frustrate, no man foresaw: no\r\nalmanack tells us when a blazing star will break out, the matter is\r\ncarried up in secret; no astrologer tells us when the effects will be\r\naccomplished, for that is a secret of a higher sphere than the other;\r\nand that which is most secret is most dangerous. It is so also here in\r\nthe societies of men, in states and commonwealths. Twenty rebellious\r\ndrums make not so dangerous a noise as a few whisperers and secret\r\nplotters in corners.

I dare not do so, O God; but as thy\r\nservant Augustine wished that Adam had not sinned, therefore that Christ\r\nmight not have died, may I not to this one purpose wish that if the\r\nserpent, before the temptation of Eve, did go upright and speak,[135]\r\nthat he did so still, because I should the sooner hear him if he spoke,\r\nthe sooner see him if he went upright? In his curse I am cursed too; his\r\ncreeping undoes me; for howsoever he begin at the heel, and do but\r\nbruise that, yet he, and _death_ in him, _is come into our\r\nwindows_;[136] into our eyes and ears, the entrances and inlets of our\r\nsoul. He works upon us in secret and we do not discern him; and one\r\ngreat work of his upon us is to make us so like himself as to sin in\r\nsecret, that others may not see us; but his masterpiece is to make us\r\nsin in secret, so as that we may not see ourselves sin. For the first,\r\nthe hiding of our sins from other men, he hath induced that which was\r\nhis offspring from the beginning, a lie;[137] for man is, in nature, yet\r\nin possession of some such sparks of ingenuity and nobleness, as that,\r\nbut to disguise evil, he would not lie. The body, the sin, is the\r\nserpent's; and the garment that covers it, the lie, is his too. These\r\nare his, but the hiding of sin from ourselves is he himself: when we\r\nhave the sting of the serpent in us, and do not sting ourselves, the\r\nvenom of sin, and no remorse for sin, then, as thy blessed Son said of\r\nJudas, _He is a devil_;[138] not that he had one, but was one; so we are\r\nbecome devils to ourselves, and we have not only a serpent in our bosom,\r\nbut we ourselves are to ourselves that serpent. How far did thy servant\r\nDavid press upon thy pardon in that petition, _Cleanse thou me from\r\nsecret sins_?[139] Can any sin be secret? for a great part of our sins,\r\nthough, says thy prophet, we conceive them in the dark, upon our bed,\r\nyet, says he, we do them in the light; there are many sins which we\r\nglory in doing, and would not do if nobody should know them. Thy blessed\r\nservant Augustine confesses that he was ashamed of his shamefacedness\r\nand tenderness of conscience, and that he often belied himself with sins\r\nwhich he never did, lest he should be unacceptable to his sinful\r\ncompanions. But if we would conceal them (thy prophet found such a\r\ndesire, and such a practice in some, when he said, _Thou hast trusted in\r\nthy wickedness, and thou hast said, None shall see me_[140]), yet can we\r\nconceal them? Thou, O God, canst hear of them by others: the voice of\r\nAbel's blood will tell thee of Cain's murder;[141] the heavens\r\nthemselves will tell thee. Heaven shall reveal his iniquity; a small\r\ncreature alone shall do it, _A bird of the air shall carry the voice,\r\nand tell the matter_;[142] thou wilt trouble no informer, thou thyself\r\nrevealedst Adam's sin to thyself;[143] and the manifestation of sin is\r\nso full to thee, as that thou shalt reveal all to all; _Thou shalt\r\nbring every work to judgment, with every secret thing;[144] and there\r\nis nothing covered that shall not be revealed_.[145] But, O my God,\r\nthere is another way of knowing my sins, which thou lovest better than\r\nany of these; to know them by my confession. As physic works, so it\r\ndraws the peccant humour to itself, that, when it is gathered together,\r\nthe weight of itself may carry that humour away; so thy Spirit returns\r\nto my memory my former sins, that, being so recollected, they may pour\r\nout themselves by confession. _When I kept silence_, says thy servant\r\nDavid, _day and night thy hand was heavy upon me_; but when I said, _I\r\nwill confess my transgressions unto the Lord, thou forgavest the\r\niniquity of my sin_.[146] Thou interpretest the very purpose of\r\nconfession so well, as that thou scarce leavest any new mercy for the\r\naction itself. This mercy thou leavest, that thou armest us thereupon\r\nagainst relapses into the sins which we have confessed. And that mercy\r\nwhich thy servant Augustine apprehends when he says to thee, \"Thou hast\r\nforgiven me those sins which I have done, and those sins which only by\r\nthy grace I have not done\": they were done in our inclination to them,\r\nand even that inclination needs thy mercy, and that mercy he calls a\r\npardon. And these are most truly secret sins, because they were never\r\ndone, and because no other man, nor I myself, but only thou knowest, how\r\nmany and how great sins I have escaped by thy grace, which, without\r\nthat, I should have multiplied against thee.\r", "bookID": "23772"}, {"text": "O eternal and most gracious God, who as thy Son Christ Jesus, though he\r\nknew all things, yet said he knew not the day of judgment, because he\r\nknew it not so as that he might tell us; so though thou knowest all my\r\nsins, yet thou knowest them not to my comfort, except thou know them by\r\nmy telling them to thee. How shall I bring to thy knowledge, by that\r\nway, those sins which I myself know not? If I accuse myself of original\r\nsin, wilt thou ask me if I know what original sin is? I know not enough\r\nof it to satisfy others, but I know enough to condemn myself, and to\r\nsolicit thee.

It is always in action and motion, still busy, still pretending to\r\ndo all, to furnish all the powers and faculties with all that they have;\r\nbut if an enemy dare rise up against it, it is the soonest endangered,\r\nthe soonest defeated of any part. The brain will hold out longer than\r\nit, and the liver longer than that; they will endure a siege; but an\r\nunnatural heat, a rebellious heat, will blow up the heart, like a mine,\r\nin a minute. But howsoever, since the heart hath the birthright and\r\nprimogeniture, and that it is nature's eldest son in us, the part which\r\nis first born to life in man, and that the other parts, as younger\r\nbrethren, and servants in his family, have a dependance upon it, it is\r\nreason that the principal care be had of it, though it be not the\r\nstrongest part, as the eldest is oftentimes not the strongest of the\r\nfamily. And since the brain, and liver, and heart hold not a triumvirate\r\nin man, a sovereignty equally shed upon them all, for his well-being, as\r\nthe four elements do for his very being, but the heart alone is in the\r\nprincipality, and in the throne, as king, the rest as subjects, though\r\nin eminent place and office, must contribute to that, as children to\r\ntheir parents, as all persons to all kinds of superiors, though\r\noftentimes those parents or those superiors be not of stronger parts\r\nthan themselves, that serve and obey them that are weaker. Neither doth\r\nthis obligation fall upon us, by second dictates of nature, by\r\nconsequences and conclusions arising out of nature, or derived from\r\nnature by discourse (as many things bind us even by the law of nature,\r\nand yet not by the primary law of nature; as all laws of propriety in\r\nthat which we possess are of the law of nature, which law is, to give\r\nevery one his own, and yet in the primary law of nature there was no\r\npropriety, no _meum et tuum_, but an universal community overall; so the\r\nobedience of superiors is of the law of nature, and yet in the primary\r\nlaw of nature there was no superiority, no magistracy); but this\r\ncontribution of assistance of all to the sovereign, of all parts to the\r\nheart, is from the very first dictates of nature, which is, in the first\r\nplace, to have care of our own preservation, to look first to\r\nourselves; for therefore doth the physician intermit the present care of\r\nbrain or liver, because there is a possibility that they may subsist,\r\nthough there be not a present and a particular care had of them, but\r\nthere is no possibility that they can subsist, if the heart perish: and\r\nso, when we seem to begin with others, in such assistances, indeed, we\r\ndo begin with ourselves, and we ourselves are principally in our\r\ncontemplation; and so all these officious and mutual assistances are but\r\ncompliments towards others, and our true end is ourselves. And this is\r\nthe reward of the pains of kings; sometimes they need the power of law\r\nto be obeyed; and when they seem to be obeyed voluntarily, they who do\r\nit do it for their own sakes. O how little a thing is all the greatness\r\nof man and through how false glasses doth he make shift to multiply it,\r\nand magnify it to himself!

And as the noblest\r\nand most generous cordials that nature or art afford, or can prepare, if\r\nthey be often taken and made familiar, become no cordials, nor have any\r\nextraordinary operation, so the greatest cordial of the heart, patience,\r\nif it be much exercised, exalts the venom and the malignity of the\r\nenemy, and the more we suffer the more we are insulted upon. When God\r\nhad made this earth of nothing, it was but a little help that he had, to\r\nmake other things of this earth: nothing can be nearer nothing than this\r\nearth; and yet how little of this earth is the greatest man! He thinks\r\nhe treads upon the earth, that all is under his feet, and the brain\r\nthat thinks so is but earth; his highest region, the flesh that covers\r\nthat, is but earth, and even the top of that, that wherein so many\r\nAbsaloms take so much pride, is but a bush growing upon that turf of\r\nearth.

Wilt thou\r\ngive me an inheritance, a filiation, any thing for my heart? O thou, who\r\nsaidst to Satan, _Hast thou considered my servant Job, that there is\r\nnone like him upon the earth_,[148] shall my fear, shall my zeal, shall\r\nmy jealousy, have leave to say to thee, Hast thou considered my heart,\r\nthat there is not so perverse a heart upon earth; and wouldst thou have\r\nthat, and shall I be thy son, thy eternal Son's coheir, for giving that?\r\n_The heart is deceitful above all things, and desperately wicked; who\r\ncan know it?_[149] He that asks that question makes the answer, I the\r\nLord search the heart. When didst thou search mine? Dost thou think to\r\nfind it, as thou madest it, in Adam? Thou hast searched since, and found\r\nall these gradations in the ill of our hearts, _that every imagination\r\nof the thoughts of our hearts is only evil continually_.[150] Dost thou\r\nremember this, and wouldst thou have my heart? O God of all light, I\r\nknow thou knowest all, and it is thou[151] that declarest unto man what\r\nis his heart. Without thee, O sovereign Goodness, I could not know how\r\nill my heart were. Thou hast declared unto me, in thy word, that for all\r\nthis deluge of evil that hath surrounded all hearts, yet thou soughtest\r\nand foundest a man after thine own heart;[152] that thou couldst and\r\nwouldst give thy people pastors according to thine own heart;[153] and I\r\ncan gather out of thy word so good testimony of the hearts of men as to\r\nfind single hearts, docile and apprehensive hearts; hearts that can,\r\nhearts that have learned; wise hearts in one place, and in another in a\r\ngreat degree wise, perfect hearts; straight hearts, no perverseness\r\nwithout; and clean hearts, no foulness within: such hearts I can find in\r\nthy word; and if my heart were such a heart, I would give thee my heart.\r\nBut I find stony hearts too,[154] and I have made mine such: I have\r\nfound hearts that are snares;[155] and I have conversed with such;\r\nhearts that burn like ovens;[156] and the fuel of lust, and envy, and\r\nambition, hath inflamed mine; hearts in which their masters trust, and\r\n_he that trusteth in his own heart is a fool_;[157] his confidence in\r\nhis own moral constancy and civil fortitude will betray him, when thou\r\nshalt cast a spiritual damp, a heaviness and dejection of spirit upon\r\nhim. I have found these hearts, and a worse than these, a heart into the\r\nwhich the devil himself is entered, Judas's heart.[158] The first kind\r\nof heart, alas, my God, I have not; the last are not hearts to be given\r\nto thee. What shall I do? Without that present I cannot be thy son, and\r\nI have it not. To those of the first kind thou givest joyfulness of\r\nheart,[159] and I have not that; to those of the other kind thou givest\r\nfaintness of heart;[160] and blessed be thou, O God, for that\r\nforbearance, I have not that yet. There is then a middle kind of hearts,\r\nnot so perfect as to be given but that the very giving mends them; not\r\nso desperate as not to be accepted but that the very accepting dignifies\r\nthem. This is a melting heart,[161] and a troubled heart, and a wounded\r\nheart, and a broken heart, and a contrite heart; and by the powerful\r\nworking of thy piercing Spirit such a heart I have. Thy Samuel spake\r\nunto all the house of thy Israel, and said, _If you return to the Lord\r\nwith all your hearts, prepare your hearts unto the Lord_.[162] If my\r\nheart be prepared, it is a returning heart. And if thou see it upon the\r\nway, thou wilt carry it home. Nay, the preparation is thine too; this\r\nmelting, this wounding, this breaking, this contrition, which I have\r\nnow, is thy way to thy end; and those discomforts are, for all that,\r\n_the earnest of thy Spirit in my heart_;[163] and where thou givest\r\nearnest, thou wilt perform the bargain. Nabal was confident upon his\r\nwine, but _in the morning his heart died within him_.[164] Thou, O Lord,\r\nhast given me wormwood, and I have had some diffidence upon that; and\r\nthou hast cleared a morning to me again, and my heart is alive. David's\r\nheart smote him when he cut off the skirt from Saul;[165] and his heart\r\nsmote him when he had numbered his people:[166] my heart hath struck me\r\nwhen I come to number my sins; but that blow is not to death, because\r\nthose sins are not to death, but my heart lives in thee. But yet as long\r\nas I remain in this great hospital, this sick, this diseaseful world, as\r\nlong as I remain in this leprous house, this flesh of mine, this heart,\r\nthough thus prepared for thee, prepared by thee, will still be subject\r\nto the invasion of malign and pestilent vapours. But I have my cordials\r\nin thy promise; _when I shall know the plague of my heart, and pray unto\r\nthee in thy house_,[167] thou wilt preserve that heart from all mortal\r\nforce of that infection; _and the peace of God, which passeth all\r\nunderstandings shall keep my heart and mind through Christ Jesus_.[168]\r", "bookID": "23772"}, {"text": "O eternal and most gracious God, who in thy upper house, the heavens,\r\nthough there be many mansions, yet art alike and equally in every\r\nmansion; but here in thy lower house, though thou fillest all, yet art\r\notherwise in some rooms thereof than in others; otherwise in thy church\r\nthan in my chamber, and otherwise in thy sacraments than in my prayers;\r\nso though thou be always present and always working in every room of\r\nthis thy house, my body, yet I humbly beseech thee to manifest always a\r\nmore effectual presence in my heart than in the other offices.

Job made a covenant with his eyes, but not his making of that\r\ncovenant, but thy dwelling in his heart, enabled him to keep that\r\ncovenant. Thy Son himself had a sadness in his soul to death, and he had\r\na reluctation, a deprecation of death, in the approaches thereof; but he\r\nhad his cordial too, _Yet not my will, but thine be done_. And as thou\r\nhast not delivered us, thine adopted sons, from these infectious\r\ntemptations, so neither hast thou delivered us over to them, nor\r\nwithheld thy cordials from us. I was baptized in thy cordial water\r\nagainst original sin, and I have drunk of thy cordial blood, for my\r\nrecovery from actual and habitual sin, in the other sacrament. Thou, O\r\nLord, who hast imprinted all medicinal virtues which are in all\r\ncreatures, and hast made even the flesh of vipers to assist in cordials,\r\nart able to make this present sickness, everlasting health, this\r\nweakness, everlasting strength, and this very dejection and faintness of\r\nheart, a powerful cordial. When thy blessed Son cried out to thee, _My\r\nGod, my God, why hast thou forsaken me?_ thou didst reach out thy hand\r\nto him; but not to deliver his sad soul, but to receive his holy soul:\r\nneither did he longer desire to hold it of thee, but to recommend it to\r\nthee. I see thine hand upon me now, O Lord, and I ask not why it comes,\r\nwhat it intends; whether thou wilt bid it stay still in this body for\r\nsome time, or bid it meet thee this day in paradise, I ask not, not in a\r\nwish, not in a thought. Infirmity of nature, curiosity of mind, are\r\ntemptations that offer; but a silent and absolute obedience to thy will,\r\neven before I know it, is my cordial. Preserve that to me, O my God, and\r\nthat will preserve me to thee; that, when thou hast catechised me with\r\naffliction here, I may take a greater degree, and serve thee in a higher\r\nplace, in thy kingdom of joy and glory.

To die by a bullet is the soldier's daily bread;\r\nbut few men die by hail-shot. A man is more worth than to be sold for\r\nsingle money; a life to be valued above a trifle. If this were a violent\r\nshaking of the air by thunder or by cannon, in that case the air is\r\ncondensed above the thickness of water, of water baked into ice, almost\r\npetrified, almost made stone, and no wonder that kills; but that which\r\nis but a vapour, and a vapour not forced but breathed, should kill, that\r\nour nurse should overlay us, and air that nourishes us should destroy\r\nus, but that it is a half atheism to murmur against Nature, who is God's\r\nimmediate commissioner, who would not think himself miserable to be put\r\ninto the hands of Nature, who does not only set him up for a mark for\r\nothers to shoot at, but delights herself to blow him up like a glass,\r\ntill she see him break, even with her own breath? Nay, if this\r\ninfectious vapour were sought for, or travelled to, as Pliny hunted\r\nafter the vapour of AEtna and dared and challenged Death in the form of a\r\nvapour to do his worst, and felt the worst, he died; or if this vapour\r\nwere met withal in an ambush, and we surprised with it, out of a long\r\nshut well, or out of a new opened mine, who would lament, who would\r\naccuse, when we had nothing to accuse, none to lament against but\r\nfortune, who is less than a vapour? But when ourselves are the well\r\nthat breathes out this exhalation, the oven that spits out this fiery\r\nsmoke, the mine that spews out this suffocating and strangling damp, who\r\ncan ever, after this, aggravate his sorrow by this circumstance, that it\r\nwas his neighbour, his familiar friend, his brother, that destroyed him,\r\nand destroyed him with a whispering and a calumniating breath, when we\r\nourselves do it to ourselves by the same means, kill ourselves with our\r\nown vapours? Or if these occasions of this self-destruction had any\r\ncontribution from our own wills, any assistance from our own intentions,\r\nnay, from our own errors, we might divide the rebuke, and chide\r\nourselves as much as them. Fevers upon wilful distempers of drink and\r\nsurfeits, consumptions upon intemperances and licentiousness, madness\r\nupon misplacing or overbending our natural faculties, proceed from\r\nourselves, and so as that ourselves are in the plot, and we are not only\r\npassive, but active too, to our own destruction. But what have I done,\r\neither to breed or to breathe these vapours? They tell me it is my\r\nmelancholy; did I infuse, did I drink in melancholy into myself? It is\r\nmy thoughtfulness; was I not made to think? It is my study; doth not my\r\ncalling call for that? I have done nothing wilfully, perversely toward\r\nit, yet must suffer in it, die by it. There are too many examples of men\r\nthat have been their own executioners, and that have made hard shift to\r\nbe so: some have always had poison about them, in a hollow ring upon\r\ntheir finger, and some in their pen that they used to write with; some\r\nhave beat out their brains at the wall of their prison, and some have\r\neat the fire out of their chimneys;[169] and one is said to have come\r\nnearer our case than so, to have strangled himself, though his hands\r\nwere bound, by crushing his throat between his knees. But I do nothing\r\nupon myself, and yet am mine own executioner. And we have heard of death\r\nupon small occasions and by scornful instruments: a pin, a comb, a hair\r\npulled, hath gangrened and killed; but when I have said a vapour, if I\r\nwere asked again what is a vapour, I could not tell, it is so insensible\r\na thing; so near nothing is that that reduces us to nothing. But extend\r\nthis vapour, rarefy it; from so narrow a room as our natural bodies, to\r\nany politic body, to a state. That which is fume in us is, in a state\r\nrumour; and these vapours in us, which we consider here pestilent and\r\ninfectious fumes, are, in a state, infecitious rumours, detracting and\r\ndishonourable calumnies, libels. The heart in that body is the king, and\r\nthe brain his council; and the whole magistracy, that ties all together,\r\nis the sinews which proceed from thence; and the life of all is honour,\r\nand just respect, and due reverence; and therefore, when these vapours,\r\nthese venomous rumours, are directed against these noble parts, the\r\nwhole body suffers. But yet for all their privileges, they are not\r\nprivileged from our misery; that as the vapours most pernicious to us\r\narise in our own bodies, so do the most dishonourable rumours, and those\r\nthat wound a state most arise at home. What ill air that I could have\r\nmet in the street, what channel, what shambles, what dunghill, what\r\nvault, could have hurt me so much as these homebred vapours? What\r\nfugitive, what almsman of any foreign state, can do so much harm as a\r\ndetractor, a libeller, a scornful jester at home? For as they that write\r\nof poisons, and of creatures naturally disposed to the ruin of man, do\r\nas well mention the flea as the viper[170], because the flea, though he\r\nkill none, he does all the harm he can; so even these libellous and\r\nlicentious jesters utter the venom they have, though sometimes virtue,\r\nand always power, be a good pigeon to draw this vapour from the head\r\nand from doing any deadly harm there.\r", "bookID": "23772"}, {"text": "My God, my God, as thy servant James, when he asks that question, _What\r\nis your life?_ provides me my answer, _It is even a vapour, that\r\nappeareth for a little time, and then vanisheth away_;[171] so, if he\r\ndid ask me what is your death, I am provided of my answer, it is a\r\nvapour too; and why should it not be all one to me, whether I live or\r\ndie, if life and death be all one, both a vapour? Thou hast made vapour\r\nso indifferent a thing as that thy blessings and thy judgments are\r\nequally expressed by it, and is made by thee the hieroglyphic of both.\r\nWhy should not that be always good by which thou hast declared thy\r\nplentiful goodness to us? _A vapour went up from the earth, and watered\r\nthe whole face of the ground._[172] And that by which thou hast imputed\r\na goodness to us, and wherein thou hast accepted our service to thee,\r\nsacrifices; for sacrifices were vapours;[173] and in them it is said,\r\nthat a _thick cloud of incense went up to thee_.[174] So it is of that\r\nwherein thou comest to us, the dew of heaven, and of that wherein we\r\ncome to thee, both are vapours; and he, in whom we have and are all that\r\nwe are or have, temporally or spiritually, thy blessed Son, in the\r\nperson of Wisdom, is called so too; _She is_ (that is, he is) _the\r\nvapour of the power of God, and the pure influence from the glory of the\r\nAlmighty._[175] Hast thou, thou, O my God, perfumed vapour with thine\r\nown breath, with so many sweet acceptations in thine own word, and shall\r\nthis vapour receive an ill and infectious sense? It must; for, since we\r\nhave displeased thee with that which is but vapour (for what is sin but\r\na vapour, but a smoke, though such a smoke as takes away our sight, and\r\ndisables us from seeing our danger), it is just that thou punish us with\r\nvapours too. For so thou dost, as the wise man tells us, thou canst\r\npunish us by those things wherein we offend thee; as he hath expressed\r\nit there, _by beasts newly created, breathing vapours_.[176] Therefore\r\nthat commination of thine, by thy prophet, _I will show wonders in the\r\nheaven, and in the earth, blood and fire, and pillars of smoke_;[177]\r\nthine apostle, who knew thy meaning best, calls _vapours of smoke_.[178]\r\nOne prophet presents thee in thy terribleness so, _There went out a\r\nsmoke at his nostrils_,[179] and another the effect of thine anger so,\r\n_The house was filled with smoke_;[180] and he that continues his\r\nprophecy as long as the world can continue, describes the miseries of\r\nthe latter times so, _Out of the bottomless pit arose a smoke, that\r\ndarkened the sun, and out of that smoke came locusts, who had the power\r\nof scorpions_.[181] Now all smokes begin in fire, and all these will end\r\nso too: the smoke of sin and of thy wrath will end in the fire of hell.\r\nBut hast thou afforded us no means to evaporate these smokes, to\r\nwithdraw these vapours? When thine angels fell from heaven, thou tookest\r\ninto thy care the reparation of that place, and didst it by assuming, by\r\ndrawing us thither; when we fell from thee here, in this world, thou\r\ntookest into thy care the reparation of this place too, and didst it by\r\nassuming us another way, by descending down to assume our nature, in thy\r\nSon. So that though our last act be an ascending to glory (we shall\r\nascend to the place of angels), yet our first act is to go the way of\r\nthy Son, descending, and the way of thy blessed Spirit too, who\r\ndescended in the dove. Therefore hast thou been pleased to afford us\r\nthis remedy in nature, by this application of a dove to our lower parts,\r\nto make these vapours in our bodies to descend, and to make that a type\r\nto us, that, by the visitation of thy Spirit, the vapours of sin shall\r\ndescend, and we tread them under our feet.

But it is far from\r\nthat; he drinks misery, and he tastes happiness; he mows misery, and he\r\ngleans happiness; he journeys in misery, he does but walk in happiness;\r\nand, which is worst, his misery is positive and dogmatical, his\r\nhappiness is but disputable and problematical: all men call misery\r\nmisery, but happiness changes the name by the taste of man. In this\r\naccident that befalls me, now that this sickness declares itself by\r\nspots to be a malignant and pestilential disease, if there be a comfort\r\nin the declaration, that thereby the physicians see more clearly what to\r\ndo, there may be as much discomfort in this, that the malignity may be\r\nso great as that all that they can do shall do nothing; that an enemy\r\ndeclares himself then, when he is able to subsist, and to pursue, and to\r\nachieve his ends, is no great comfort. In intestine conspiracies,\r\nvoluntary confessions do more good than confessions upon the rack; in\r\nthese infections, when nature herself confesses and cries out by these\r\noutward declarations which she is able to put forth of herself, they\r\nminister comfort; but when all is by the strength of cordials, it is but\r\na confession upon the rack, by which, though we come to know the malice\r\nof that man, yet we do not know whether there be not as much malice in\r\nhis heart then as before his confession; we are sure of his treason, but\r\nnot of his repentance; sure of him, but not of his accomplices. It is a\r\nfaint comfort to know the worst when the worst is remediless, and a\r\nweaker than that to know much ill, and not to know that that is the\r\nworst. A woman is comforted with the birth of her son, her body is eased\r\nof a burden; but if she could prophetically read his history, how ill a\r\nman, perchance how ill a son, he would prove, she should receive a\r\ngreater burden into her mind.

Thus\r\nmuch must necessarily be presented to his remembrance, that those false\r\nhappinesses which he hath in this world, have their times, and their\r\nseasons, and their critical days; and they are judged and denominated\r\naccording to the times when they befall us. What poor elements are our\r\nhappinesses made of, if time, time which we can scarce consider to be\r\nany thing, be an essential part of our happiness! All things are done in\r\nsome place; but if we consider place to be no more but the next hollow\r\nsuperficies of the air, alas! how thin and fluid a thing is air, and how\r\nthin a film is a superficies, and a superficies of air! All things are\r\ndone in time too, but if we consider time to be but the measure of\r\nmotion, and howsoever it may seem to have three stations, past, present,\r\nand future, yet the first and last of these are not (one is not now, and\r\nthe other is not yet), and that which you call present, is not now the\r\nsame that it was when you began to call it so in this line (before you\r\nsound that word present, or that monosyllable now, the present and the\r\nnow is past). If this imaginary, half-nothing time, be of the essence of\r\nour happinesses, how can they be thought durable? Time is not so; how\r\ncan they be thought to be? Time is not so; not so considered in any of\r\nthe parts thereof. If we consider eternity, into that time never\r\nentered; eternity is not an everlasting flux of time, but time is a\r\nshort parenthesis in a long period; and eternity had been the same as it\r\nis, though time had never been. If we consider, not eternity, but\r\nperpetuity; not that which had no time to begin in, but which shall\r\noutlive time, and be when time shall be no more, what a minute is the\r\nlife of the durablest creature compared to that! and what a minute is\r\nman's life in respect of the sun's, or of a tree? and yet how little of\r\nour life is occasion, opportunity to receive good in; and how little of\r\nthat occasion do we apprehend and lay hold of? How busy and perplexed a\r\ncobweb is the happiness of man here, that must be made up with a\r\nwatchfulness to lay hold upon occasion, which is but a little piece of\r\nthat which is nothing, time? and yet the best things are nothing without\r\nthat. Honours, pleasures, possessions, presented to us out of time? in\r\nour decrepit and distasted and unapprehensive age, lose their office,\r\nand lose their name; they are not honours to us that shall never appear,\r\nnor come abroad into the eyes of the people, to receive honour from them\r\nwho give it; nor pleasures to us, who have lost our sense to taste\r\nthem; nor possessions to us, who are departing from the possession of\r\nthem. Youth is their critical day, that judges them, that denominates\r\nthem, that inanimates and informs them, and makes them honours, and\r\npleasures, and possessions; and when they come in an unapprehensive age,\r\nthey come as a cordial when the bell rings out, as a pardon when the\r\nhead is off. We rejoice in the comfort of fire, but does any man cleave\r\nto it at midsummer? We are glad of the freshness and coolness of a\r\nvault, but does any man keep his Christmas there; or are the pleasures\r\nof the spring acceptable in autumn?

Wouldst thou\r\nchide us for _standing idle here all the day_,[195] if we were sure to\r\nhave more days to make up our harvest? When thou bidst us _take no\r\nthought for to-morrow, for sufficient unto the day_ (to every day) _is\r\nthe evil thereof_,[196] is this truly, absolutely, to put off all that\r\nconcerns the present life? When thou reprehendest the Galatians by thy\r\nmessage to them, _That they observed days, and months, and times, and\r\nyears_,[197] when thou sendest by the same messenger to forbid the\r\nColossians all critical days, indicatory days, _Let no man judge you in\r\nrespect of a holy day, or of a new moon, or of a sabbath_,[198] dost\r\nthou take away all consideration, all distinction of days? Though thou\r\nremove them from being of the essence of our salvation, thou leavest\r\nthem for assistances, and for the exaltation of our devotion, to fix\r\nourselves, at certain periodical and stationary times, upon the\r\nconsideration of those things which thou hast done for us, and the\r\ncrisis, the trial, the judgment, how those things have wrought upon us\r\nand disposed us to a spiritual recovery and convalescence. For there is\r\nto every man a day of salvation. _Now is the accepted time, now is the\r\nday of salvation_,[199] and there is _a great day of thy wrath_,[200]\r\nwhich no man shall be able to stand in; and there are evil days before,\r\nand therefore thou warnest us and armest us, _Take unto you the whole\r\narmour of God, that you may be able to stand in the evil day_.[201] So\r\nfar then our days must be critical to us, as that by consideration of\r\nthem, we may make a judgment of our spiritual health, for that is the\r\ncrisis of our bodily health. Thy beloved servant, St. John, wishes to\r\nGaius, _that he may prosper in his health, so as his soul\r\nprospers_;[202] for if the soul be lean the marrow of the body is but\r\nwater; if the soul wither, the verdure and the good estate of the body\r\nis but an illusion and the goodliest man a fearful ghost. Shall we, O my\r\nGod, determine our thoughts, and shall we never determine our\r\ndisputations upon our climacterical years, for particular men and\r\nperiodical years, for the life of states and kingdoms, and never\r\nconsider these in our long life, and our interest in the everlasting\r\nkingdom? We have exercised our curiosity in observing that Adam, the\r\neldest of the eldest world, died in his climacterical year, and Shem,\r\nthe eldest son of the next world, in his; Abraham, the father of the\r\nfaithful, in his, and the blessed Virgin Mary, the garden where the\r\nroot of faith grew, in hers. But they whose climacterics we observe,\r\nemployed their observation upon their critical days, the working of thy\r\npromise of a Messias upon them. And shall we, O my God, make less use of\r\nthose days who have more of them? We, who have not only the day of the\r\nprophets, the first days, but the last days, in which thou hast spoken\r\nunto us by thy Son?[203] We are the children of the day,[204] for thou\r\nhast shined in as full a noon upon us as upon the Thessalonians: they\r\nwho were of the night (a night which they had superinduced upon\r\nthemselves), the Pharisees, pretended, _that if they had been in their\r\nfathers' days_ (those indicatory and judicatory, those critical days),\r\n_they would not have been partakers of the blood of the prophets_;[205]\r\nand shall we who are in the day, these days, not of the prophets, but of\r\nthe Son, stone those prophets again, and crucify that Son again, for all\r\nthose evident indications and critical judicatures which are afforded\r\nus? Those opposed adversaries of thy Son, the Pharisees, with the\r\nHerodians, watched a critical day; then when the state was incensed\r\nagainst him, came to tempt him in the dangerous question of\r\ntribute.[206] They left him, and that day was the critical day to the\r\nSadducees. The same day, says thy Spirit in thy word, the Sadducees came\r\nto him to question him about the resurrection,[207] and them he\r\nsilenced; they left him, and this was the critical day for the Scribe,\r\nexpert in the law, who thought himself learneder than the Herodian, the\r\nPharisee, or Sadducee; and he tempted him about the great\r\ncommandment,[208] and him Christ left without power of replying. When\r\nall was done, and that they went about to begin their circle of vexation\r\nand temptation again, Christ silences them so, that as they had taken\r\ntheir critical days, to come in that and in that day, so Christ imposes\r\na critical day upon them. _From that day forth_, says thy Spirit, _no\r\nman durst ask him any more questions_.[209] This, O my God, my most\r\nblessed God, is a fearful crisis, a fearful indication, when we will\r\nstudy, and seek, and find, what days are fittest to forsake thee in; to\r\nsay, now religion is in a neutrality in the world, and this is my day,\r\nthe day of liberty; now I may make new friends by changing my old\r\nreligion, and this is my day, the day of advancement. But, O my God,\r\nwith thy servant Jacob's holy boldness, who, though thou lamedst him,\r\nwould not let thee go till thou hadst given him a blessing;[210] though\r\nthou have laid me upon my hearse, yet thou shalt not depart from me,\r\nfrom this bed, till thou have given me a crisis, a judgment upon myself\r\nthis day. Since _a day is as a thousand years with thee_,[211] let, O\r\nLord, a day be as a week to me; and in this one, let me consider seven\r\ndays, seven critical days, and judge myself that I be not judged by\r\nthee. First, this is the day of thy visitation, thy coming to me; and\r\nwould I look to be welcome to thee, and not entertain thee in thy coming\r\nto me? We measure not the visitations of great persons by their apparel,\r\nby their equipage, by the solemnity of their coming, but by their very\r\ncoming; and therefore, howsoever thou come, it is a crisis to me, that\r\nthou wouldst not lose me who seekest me by any means. This leads me from\r\nmy first day, thy visitation by sickness, to a second, to the light and\r\ntestimony of my conscience. There I have an evening and a morning, a sad\r\nguiltiness in my soul, but yet a cheerful rising of thy Sun too; thy\r\nevenings and mornings made days in the creation, and there is no mention\r\nof nights; my sadnesses for sins are evenings, but they determine not\r\nin night, but deliver me over to the day, the day of a conscience\r\ndejected, but then rectified, accused, but then acquitted, by thee, by\r\nhim who speaks thy word, and who is thy word, thy Son. From this day,\r\nthe crisis and examination of my conscience, breaks out my third day, my\r\nday of preparing and fitting myself for a more especial receiving of thy\r\nSon in his institution of the Sacrament; in which day, though there be\r\nmany dark passages and slippery steps to them who will entangle and\r\nendanger themselves in unnecessary disputations, yet there are light\r\nhours enough for any man to go his whole journey intended by thee, to\r\nknow that that bread and wine is not more really assimilated to my body,\r\nand to my blood, than the body and blood of thy Son is communicated to\r\nme in that action, and participation of that bread and that wine. And\r\nhaving, O my God, walked with thee these three days, the day of thy\r\nvisitation, the day of my conscience, the day of preparing for this seal\r\nof reconciliation, I am the less afraid of the clouds or storms of my\r\nfourth day, the day of my dissolution and transmigration from hence.\r\nNothing deserves the name of happiness that makes the remembrance of\r\ndeath bitter; and, _O death, how bitter is the remembrance of thee, to a\r\nman that lives at rest in his possessions, the man that hath nothing to\r\nvex him, yea unto him that is able to receive meat!_[212] Therefore hast\r\nthou, O my God, made this sickness, in which I am not able to receive\r\nmeat, my fasting day, my eve to this great festival, my dissolution. And\r\nthis day of death shall deliver me over to my fifth day, the day of my\r\nresurrection; for how long a day soever thou make that day in the grave,\r\nyet there is no day between that and the resurrection. Then we shall all\r\nbe invested, reapparelled in our own bodies; but they who have made\r\njust use of their former days be super-invested with glory; whereas the\r\nothers, condemned to their old clothes, their sinful bodies, shall have\r\nnothing added but immortality to torment. And this day of awaking me,\r\nand reinvesting my soul in my body, and my body in the body of Christ,\r\nshall present me, body and soul, to my sixth day, the day of judgment,\r\nwhich is truly, and most literally, the critical, the decretory day;\r\nboth because all judgment shall be manifested to me then, and I shall\r\nassist in judging the world then, and because then, that judgment shall\r\ndeclare to me, and possess me of my seventh day, my everlasting Sabbath\r\nin thy rest, thy glory, thy joy, thy sight, thyself; and where I shall\r\nlive as long without reckoning any more days after, as thy Son and thy\r\nHoly Spirit lived with thee, before you three made any days in the\r\ncreation.\r", "bookID": "23772"}, {"text": "O eternal and most gracious God, who, though thou didst permit darkness\r\nto be before light in the creation, yet in the making of light didst so\r\nmultiply that light, as that it enlightened not the day only, but the\r\nnight too; though thou have suffered some dimness, some clouds of\r\nsadness and disconsolateness to shed themselves upon my soul, I humbly\r\nbless and thankfully glorify thy holy name, that thou hast afforded me\r\nthe light of thy Spirit, against which the prince of darkness cannot\r\nprevail, nor hinder his illumination of our darkest nights, of our\r\nsaddest thoughts.

Sleep is an opiate\r\nwhich gives us rest, but such an opiate, as perchance, being under it,\r\nwe shall wake no more. But though natural men, who have induced\r\nsecondary and figurative considerations, have found out this second,\r\nthis emblematical use of sleep, that it should be a representation of\r\ndeath, God, who wrought and perfected his work before nature began (for\r\nnature was but his apprentice, to learn in the first seven days, and now\r\nis his foreman, and works next under him), God, I say, intended sleep\r\nonly for the refreshing of man by bodily rest, and not for a figure of\r\ndeath, for he intended not death itself then. But man having induced\r\ndeath upon himself, God hath taken man's creature, death, into his hand,\r\nand mended it; and whereas it hath in itself a fearful form and aspect,\r\nso that man is afraid of his own creature, God presents it to him in a\r\nfamiliar, in an assiduous, in an agreeable and acceptable form, in\r\nsleep; that so when he awakes from sleep, and says to himself, \"Shall I\r\nbe no otherwise when I am dead, than I was even now when I was asleep?\"\r\nhe may be ashamed of his waking dreams, and of his melancholy fancying\r\nout a horrid and an affrightful figure of that death which is so like\r\nsleep. As then we need sleep to live out our threescore and ten years,\r\nso we need death to live that life which we cannot outlive. And as death\r\nbeing our enemy, God allows us to defend ourselves against it (for we\r\nvictual ourselves against death twice every day), as often as we eat, so\r\nGod having so sweetened death unto us as he hath in sleep, we put\r\nourselves into our enemy's hands once every day, so far as sleep is\r\ndeath; and sleep is as much death as meat is life. This then is the\r\nmisery of my sickness, that death, as it is produced from me and is mine\r\nown creature, is now before mine eyes, but in that form in which God\r\nhath mollified it to us, and made it acceptable, in sleep I cannot see\r\nit. How many prisoners, who have even hollowed themselves their graves\r\nupon that earth on which they have lain long under heavy fetters, yet at\r\nthis hour are asleep, though they be yet working upon their own graves\r\nby their own weight?

Why\r\nis none of the heaviness of my heart dispensed into mine eye-lids, that\r\nthey might fall as my heart doth? And why, since I have lost my delight\r\nin all objects, cannot I discontinue the faculty of seeing them by\r\nclosing mine eyes in sleep?

If Samson had slept any longer in Gaza, he had been taken;[226]\r\nand when he did sleep longer with Delilah,[227] he was taken. Sleep is\r\nas often taken for natural death in thy Scriptures, as for natural rest.\r\nNay, sometimes sleep hath so heavy a sense, as to be taken for sin\r\nitself,[228] as well as for the punishment of sin, death.[229] Much\r\ncomfort is not in much sleep, when the most fearful and most irrevocable\r\nmalediction is presented by thee in a perpetual sleep. _I will make\r\ntheir feasts, and I will make them drunk, and they shall sleep a\r\nperpetual sleep, and not wake._[230] I must therefore, O my God, look\r\nfarther than into the very act of sleeping before I misinterpret my\r\nwaking; for since I find thy whole hand light, shall any finger of that\r\nhand seem heavy? Since the whole sickness is thy physic, shall any\r\naccident in it be my poison by my murmuring? The name of watchmen\r\nbelongs to our profession; thy prophets are not only seers, endued with\r\na power of seeing, able to see, but watchmen evermore in the act of\r\nseeing. And therefore give me leave, O my blessed God, to invert the\r\nwords of thy Son's spouse: she said, _I sleep, but my heart\r\nwaketh_;[231] I say, I wake, but my heart sleepeth: my body is in a sick\r\nweariness, but my soul in a peaceful rest with thee; and as our eyes in\r\nour health see not the air that is next them, nor the fire, nor the\r\nspheres, nor stop upon any thing till they come to stars, so my eyes\r\nthat are open, see nothing of this world, but pass through all that, and\r\nfix themselves upon thy peace, and joy, and glory above. Almost as soon\r\nas thy apostle had said, _Let us not sleep_,[232] lest we should be too\r\nmuch discomforted if we did, he says again, _Whether we wake or sleep,\r\nlet us live together with Christ_.[233] Though then this absence of\r\nsleep may argue the presence of death (the original may exclude the\r\ncopy, the life the picture), yet this gentle sleep and rest of my soul\r\nbetroths me to thee, to whom I shall be married indissolubly, though by\r\nthis way of dissolution.\r", "bookID": "23772"}, {"text": "O eternal and most gracious God, who art able to make, and dost make,\r\nthe sick bed of thy servants chapels of ease to them, and the dreams of\r\nthy servants prayers and meditations upon thee, let not this continual\r\nwatchfulness of mine, this inability to sleep, which thou hast laid upon\r\nme, be any disquiet or discomfort to me, but rather an argument, that\r\nthou wouldst not have me sleep in thy presence.

When the Turks took Constantinople, they melted the bells into\r\nordnance; I have heard both bells and ordnance, but never been so much\r\naffected with those as with these bells. I have lain near a steeple[235]\r\nin which there are said to be more than thirty bells, and near another,\r\nwhere there is one so big, as that the clapper is said to weigh more\r\nthan six hundred pounds,[236] yet never so affected as here. Here the\r\nbells can scarce solemnize the funeral of any person, but that I knew\r\nhim, or knew that he was my neighbour: we dwelt in houses near to one\r\nanother before, but now he is gone into that house into which I must\r\nfollow him. There is a way of correcting the children of great persons,\r\nthat other children are corrected in their behalf, and in their names,\r\nand this works upon them who indeed had more deserved it. And when these\r\nbells tell me, that now one, and now another is buried, must not I\r\nacknowledge that they have the correction due to me, and paid the debt\r\nthat I owe? There is a story of a bell in a monastery[237] which, when\r\nany of the house was sick to death, rung always voluntarily, and they\r\nknew the inevitableness of the danger by that. It rung once when no man\r\nwas sick, but the next day one of the house fell from the steeple and\r\ndied, and the bell held the reputation of a prophet still. If these\r\nbells that warn to a funeral now, were appropriated to none, may not I,\r\nby the hour of the funeral, supply? How many men that stand at an\r\nexecution, if they would ask, For what dies that man? should hear their\r\nown faults condemned, and see themselves executed by attorney? We scarce\r\nhear of any man preferred, but we think of ourselves that we might very\r\nwell have been that man; why might not I have been that man that is\r\ncarried to his grave now?

In the first\r\ninstitution of thy church in this world, in the foundation of thy\r\nmilitant church amongst the Jews, thou didst appoint the calling of the\r\nassembly in to be by trumpet;[238] and when they were in, then thou\r\ngavest them the sound of bells in the garment of thy priest.[239] In the\r\ntriumphant church, thou employest both too, but in an inverted order;\r\nwe enter into the triumphant church by the sound of bells (for we enter\r\nwhen we die); and then we receive our further edification, or\r\nconsummation, by the sound of trumpets at the resurrection. The sound of\r\nthy trumpets thou didst impart to secular and civil uses too, but the\r\nsound of bells only to sacred. Lord, let not us break the communion of\r\nsaints in that which was intended for the advancement of it; let not\r\nthat pull us asunder from one another, which was intended for the\r\nassembling of us in the militant, and associating of us to the\r\ntriumphant church. But he, for whose funeral these bells ring now, was\r\nat home, at his journey's end yesterday; why ring they now? A man, that\r\nis a world, is all the things in the world; he is an army, and when an\r\narmy marches, the van may lodge to-night where the rear comes not till\r\nto-morrow. A man extends to his act and to his example; to that which he\r\ndoes, and that which he teaches; so do those things that concern him, so\r\ndo these bells; that which rung yesterday was to convey him out of the\r\nworld in his van, in his soul; that which rung to-day was to bring him\r\nin his rear, in his body, to the church; and this continuing of ringing\r\nafter his entering is to bring him to me in the application. Where I lie\r\nI could hear the psalm, and did join with the congregation in it; but I\r\ncould not hear the sermon, and these latter bells are a repetition\r\nsermon to me. But, O my God, my God, do I that have this fever need\r\nother remembrances of my mortality? Is not mine own hollow voice, voice\r\nenough to pronounce that to me? Need I look upon a death's head in a\r\nring, that have one in my face? or go for death to my neighbour's house,\r\nthat have him in my bosom? We cannot, we cannot, O my God, take in too\r\nmany helps for religious duties; I know I cannot have any better image\r\nof thee than thy Son, nor any better image of him than his Gospel; yet\r\nmust not I with thanks confess to thee, that some historical pictures of\r\nhis have sometimes put me upon better meditations than otherwise I\r\nshould have fallen upon? I know thy church needed not to have taken in,\r\nfrom Jew, or Gentile, any supplies for the exaltation of thy glory, or\r\nour devotion; of absolute necessity I know she needed not; but yet we\r\nowe thee our thanks, that thou hast given her leave to do so, and that\r\nas, in making us Christians, thou didst not destroy that which we were\r\nbefore, natural men, so, in the exalting of our religious devotions now\r\nwe are Christians, thou hast been pleased to continue to us those\r\nassistances which did work upon the affections of natural men before;\r\nfor thou lovest a good man as thou lovest a good Christian; and though\r\ngrace be merely from me, yet thou dost not plant grace but in good\r\nnatures.\r", "bookID": "23772"}, {"text": "O eternal and most gracious God, who having consecrated our living\r\nbodies to thine own Spirit, and made us temples of the Holy Ghost, dost\r\nalso require a respect to be given to these temples, even when the\r\npriest is gone out of them, to these bodies when the soul is departed\r\nfrom them, I bless and glorify thy name, that as thou takest care in our\r\nlife of every hair of our head, so dost thou also of every grain of\r\nashes after our death. Neither dost thou only do good to us all in life\r\nand death, but also wouldst have us do good to one another, as in a holy\r\nlife, so in those things which accompany our death. In that\r\ncontemplation I make account that I hear this dead brother of ours, who\r\nis now carried out to his burial, to speak to me, and to preach my\r\nfuneral sermon in the voice of these bells. In him, O God, thou hast\r\naccomplished to me even the request of Dives to Abraham; thou hast sent\r\none from the dead to speak unto me. He speaks to me aloud from that\r\nsteeple; he whispers to me at these curtains, and he speaks thy words:\r\n_Blessed are the dead which die in the Lord from henceforth_.[240] Let\r\nthis prayer therefore, O my God, be as my last gasp, my expiring, my\r\ndying in thee; that if this be the hour of my transmigration, I may die\r\nthe death of a sinner, drowned in my sins, in the blood of thy Son; and\r\nif I live longer, yet I may now die the death of the righteous, die to\r\nsin; which death is a resurrection to a new life. _Thou killest and thou\r\ngivest life_: whichsoever comes, it comes from thee; which way soever it\r\ncomes, let me come to thee.\r", "bookID": "23772"}, {"text": "Perchance he for whom this bell tolls may be so ill, as that he knows\r\nnot it tolls for him; and perchance I may think myself so much better\r\nthan I am, as that they who are about me, and see my state, may have\r\ncaused it to toll for me, and I know not that. The church is Catholic,\r\nuniversal, so are all her actions; all that she does belongs to all.\r\nWhen she baptizes a child, that action concerns me; for that child is\r\nthereby connected to that body which is my head too, and ingrafted into\r\nthat body whereof I am a member. And when she buries a man, that action\r\nconcerns me: all mankind is of one author, and is one volume; when one\r\nman dies, one chapter is not torn out of the book, but translated into a\r\nbetter language; and every chapter must be so translated; God employs\r\nseveral translators; some pieces are translated by age, some by\r\nsickness, some by war, some by justice; but God's hand is in every\r\ntranslation, and his hand shall bind up all our scattered leaves again\r\nfor that library where every book shall lie open to one another. As\r\ntherefore the bell that rings to a sermon calls not upon the preacher\r\nonly, but upon the congregation to come, so this bell calls us all; but\r\nhow much more me, who am brought so near the door by this sickness.\r\nThere was a contention as far as a suit (in which both piety and\r\ndignity, religion and estimation, were mingled), which of the religious\r\norders should ring to prayers first in the morning; and it was\r\ndetermined, that they should ring first that rose earliest. If we\r\nunderstand aright the dignity of this bell that tolls for our evening\r\nprayer, we would be glad to make it ours by rising early, in that\r\napplication, that it might be ours as well as his, whose indeed it is.\r\nThe bell doth toll for him that thinks it doth; and though it intermit\r\nagain, yet from that minute that that occasion wrought upon him, he is\r\nunited to God. Who casts not up his eye to the sun when it rises? but\r\nwho takes off his eye from a comet when that breaks out? Who bends not\r\nhis ear to any bell which upon any occasion rings? but who can remove it\r\nfrom that bell which is passing a piece of himself out of this world? No\r\nman is an island, entire of itself; every man is a piece of the\r\ncontinent, a part of the main. If a clod be washed away by the sea,\r\nEurope is the less, as well as if a promontory were, as well as if a\r\nmanor of thy friend's or of thine own were: any man's death diminishes\r\nme, because I am involved in mankind, and therefore never send to know\r\nfor whom the bells tolls; it tolls for thee. Neither can we call this a\r\nbegging of misery, or a borrowing of misery, as though we were not\r\nmiserable enough of ourselves, but must fetch in more from the next\r\nhouse, in taking upon us the misery of our neighbours. Truly it were an\r\nexcusable covetousness if we did, for affliction is a treasure, and\r\nscarce any man hath enough of it. No man hath affliction enough that is\r\nnot matured and ripened by it, and made fit for God by that affliction.\r\nIf a man carry treasure in bullion, or in a wedge of gold, and have none\r\ncoined into current money, his treasure will not defray him as he\r\ntravels.

Another man may be sick too, and sick to death, and\r\nthis affliction may lie in his bowels, as gold in a mine, and be of no\r\nuse to him; but this bell, that tells me of his affliction, digs out and\r\napplies that gold to me: if by this consideration of another's danger I\r\ntake mine own into contemplation, and so secure myself, by making my\r\nrecourse to my God, who is our only security.\r", "bookID": "23772"}, {"text": "My God, my God, is this one of thy ways of drawing light out of\r\ndarkness, to make him for whom this bell tolls, now in this dimness of\r\nhis sight, to become a superintendent, an overseer, a bishop, to as many\r\nas hear his voice in this bell, and to give us a confirmation in this\r\naction? Is this one of thy ways, to raise strength out of weakness, to\r\nmake him who cannot rise from his bed, nor stir in his bed, come home\r\nto me, and in this sound give me the strength of healthy and vigorous\r\ninstructions?

I hear thy apostle saying, _I think it meet to put\r\nyou in remembrance, knowing that shortly I must go out of this\r\ntabernacle_:[244] this is the publishing of his will, and this bell is\r\nour legacy, the applying of his present condition to our use. I hear\r\nthat which makes all sounds music, and all music perfect; I hear thy Son\r\nhimself saying, _Let not your hearts be troubled_;[245] only I hear this\r\nchange, that whereas thy Son says there, _I go to prepare a place for\r\nyou_, this man in this sound says, I send to prepare you for a place,\r\nfor a grave. But, O my God, my God, since heaven is glory and joy, why\r\ndo not glorious and joyful things lead us, induce us to heaven? Thy\r\nlegacies in thy first will, in the Old Testament, were plenty and\r\nvictory, wine and oil, milk and honey, alliances of friends, ruin of\r\nenemies, peaceful hearts and cheerful countenances, and by these\r\ngalleries thou broughtest them into thy bedchamber, by these glories and\r\njoys, to the joys and glories of heaven. Why hast thou changed thine old\r\nway, and carried us by the ways of discipline and mortification, by the\r\nways of mourning and lamentation, by the ways of miserable ends and\r\nmiserable anticipations of those miseries, in appropriating the exemplar\r\nmiseries of others to ourselves, and usurping upon their miseries as our\r\nown, to our prejudice? Is the glory of heaven no perfecter in itself,\r\nbut that it needs a foil of depression and ingloriousness in this world,\r\nto set it off? Is the joy of heaven no perfecter in itself, but that it\r\nneeds the sourness of this life to give it a taste? Is that joy and that\r\nglory but a comparative glory and a comparative joy? not such in itself,\r\nbut such in comparison of the joylessness and the ingloriousness of this\r\nworld? I know, my God, it is far, far otherwise. As thou thyself, who\r\nart all, art made of no substances, so the joys and glory which are with\r\nthee are made of none of these circumstances, essential joy, and glory\r\nessential.

His soul is gone out, and as a man who had a lease\r\nof one thousand years after the expiration of a short one, or an\r\ninheritance after the life of a man in a consumption, he is now entered\r\ninto the possession of his better estate. His soul is gone, whither? Who\r\nsaw it come in, or who saw it go out? Nobody; yet everybody is sure he\r\nhad one, and hath none. If I will ask mere philosophers what the soul\r\nis, I shall find amongst them that will tell me, it is nothing but the\r\ntemperament and harmony, and just and equal composition of the elements\r\nin the body, which produces all those faculties which we ascribe to the\r\nsoul; and so in itself is nothing, no separable substance that overlives\r\nthe body. They see the soul is nothing else in other creatures, and they\r\naffect an impious humility to think as low of man. But if my soul were\r\nno more than the soul of a beast, I could not think so; that soul that\r\ncan reflect upon itself, consider itself, is more than so. If I will\r\nask, not mere philosophers, but mixed men, philosophical divines, how\r\nthe soul, being a separate substance, enters into man, I shall find some\r\nthat will tell me, that it is by generation and procreation from\r\nparents, because they think it hard to charge the soul with the\r\nguiltiness of original sin if the soul were infused into a body in which\r\nit must necessarily grow foul, and contract original sin whether it\r\nwill or no; and I shall find some that will tell me, that it is by\r\nimmediate infusion from God, because they think it hard to maintain an\r\nimmortality in such a soul, as should be begotten and derived with the\r\nbody from mortal parents. If I will ask, not a few men, but almost whole\r\nbodies, whole churches, what becomes of the souls of the righteous at\r\nthe departing thereof from the body, I shall be told by some, that they\r\nattend an expiation, a purification in a place of torment; by some, that\r\nthey attend the fruition of the sight of God in a place of rest, but yet\r\nbut of expectation; by some, that they pass to an immediate possession\r\nof the presence of God. St. Augustine studied the nature of the soul as\r\nmuch as any thing, but the salvation of the soul; and he sent an express\r\nmessenger to St. Hierome, to consult of some things concerning the soul;\r\nbut he satisfies himself with this: \"Let the departure of my soul to\r\nsalvation be evident to my faith, and I care the less how dark the\r\nentrance of my soul into my body be to my reason.\" It is the going out,\r\nmore than the coming in, that concerns us. This soul this bell tells me\r\nis gone out, whither? Who shall tell me that? I know not who it is, much\r\nless what he was, the condition of the man, and the course of his life,\r\nwhich should tell me whither he is gone, I know not. I was not there in\r\nhis sickness, nor at his death; I saw not his way nor his end, nor can\r\nask them who did, thereby to conclude or argue whither he is gone. But\r\nyet I have one nearer me than all these, mine own charity; I ask that,\r\nand that tells me he is gone to everlasting rest, and joy, and glory. I\r\nowe him a good opinion; it is but thankful charity in me, because I\r\nreceived benefit and instruction from him when his bell tolled; and I,\r\nbeing made the fitter to pray by that disposition, wherein I was\r\nassisted by his occasion, did pray for him; and I pray not without\r\nfaith; so I do charitably, so I do faithfully believe, that that soul is\r\ngone to everlasting rest, and joy, and glory. But for the body, how poor\r\na wretched thing is that? we cannot express it so fast, as it grows\r\nworse and worse. That body, which scarce three minutes since was such a\r\nhouse, as that that soul, which made but one step from thence to heaven,\r\nwas scarce thoroughly content to leave that for heaven; that body hath\r\nlost the name of a dwelling-house, because none dwells in it, and is\r\nmaking haste to lose the name of a body, and dissolve to putrefaction.\r\nWho would not be affected to see a clear and sweet river in the morning,\r\ngrow a kennel of muddy land-water by noon, and condemned to the saltness\r\nof the sea by night? and how lame a picture, how faint a representation\r\nis that, of the precipitation of man's body to dissolution? Now all the\r\nparts built up, and knit by a lovely soul, now but a statue of clay, and\r\nnow these limbs melted off, as if that clay were but snow; and now the\r\nwhole house is but a handful of sand, so much dust, and but a peck of\r\nrubbish, so much bone. If he who, as this bell tells me, is gone now,\r\nwere some excellent artificer, who comes to him for a cloak or for a\r\ngarment now? or for counsel, if he were a lawyer? if a magistrate, for\r\njustice? Man, before he hath his immortal soul, hath a soul of sense,\r\nand a soul of vegetation before that: this immortal soul did not forbid\r\nother souls to be in us before, but when this soul departs, it carries\r\nall with it; no more vegetation, no more sense. Such a mother-in-law is\r\nthe earth, in respect of our natural mother; in her womb we grew, and\r\nwhen she was delivered of us, we were planted in some place, in some\r\ncalling in the world; in the womb of the earth we diminish, and when she\r\nis delivered of us, our grave opened for another; we are not\r\ntransplanted, but transported, our dust blown away with profane dust,\r\nwith every wind.\r", "bookID": "23772"}, {"text": "My God, my God, if expostulation be too bold a word, do thou mollify it\r\nwith another; let it be wonder in myself, let it be but problem to\r\nothers; but let me ask, why wouldst thou not suffer those that serve\r\nthee in holy services, to do any office about the dead,[247] nor assist\r\nat their funeral? Thou hadst no counsellor, thou needst none; thou hast\r\nno controller, thou admittedst none. Why do I ask? In ceremonial things\r\n(as that was) any convenient reason is enough; who can be sure to\r\npropose that reason, that moved thee in the institution thereof? I\r\nsatisfy myself with this; that in those times the Gentiles were\r\nover-full of an over-reverent respect to the memory of the dead: a great\r\npart of the idolatry of the nations flowed from that; an over-amorous\r\ndevotion, an over-zealous celebrating, and over-studious preserving of\r\nthe memories, and the pictures of some dead persons; and by _the vain\r\nglory of men, they entered into the world_,[248] and their statues and\r\npictures contracted an opinion of divinity by age: that which was at\r\nfirst but a picture of a friend grew a god in time, as the wise man\r\nnotes, _They called them gods, which were the work of an ancient\r\nhand_.[249] And some have assigned a certain time, when a picture should\r\ncome out of minority, and be at age to be a god in sixty years after it\r\nis made. Those images of men that had life, and some idols of other\r\nthings which never had any being, are by one common name called\r\npromiscuously dead; and for that the wise man reprehends the idolater,\r\n_for health he prays to that which is weak, and for life he prays to\r\nthat which is dead_.[250] Should we do so? says thy prophet;[251]\r\n_should we go from the living to the dead?_ So much ill then being\r\noccasioned by so much religious compliment exhibited to the dead, thou,\r\nO God (I think), wouldst therefore inhibit thy principal holy servants\r\nfrom contributing any thing at all to this dangerous intimation of\r\nidolatry; and that the people might say, Surely those dead men are not\r\nso much to be magnified as men mistake, since God will not suffer his\r\nholy officers so much as to touch them, not to see them. But those\r\ndangers being removed, thou, O my God, dost certainly allow that we\r\nshould do offices of piety to the dead and that we should draw\r\ninstructions to piety from the dead. Is not this, O my God, a holy kind\r\nof raising up seed to my dead brother, if I, by the meditation of his\r\ndeath produce a better life in myself? It is the blessing upon Reuben,\r\n_Let Reuben live, and not die, and let not his men be few_;[252] let him\r\npropagate many. And it is a malediction, _That that dieth, let it\r\ndie_,[253] let it do no good in dying; for _trees without fruit_, thou,\r\nby thy apostle, callest _twice dead_.[254] It is a second death, if none\r\nlive the better by me after my death, by the manner of my death.\r\nTherefore may I justly think, that thou madest that a way to convey to\r\nthe Egyptians a fear of thee and a fear of death, that _there was not a\r\nhouse where there was not one dead_;[255] for thereupon the Egyptians\r\nsaid, _We are all dead men_: the death of others should catechise us to\r\ndeath. Thy Son Christ Jesus is the _first begotten of the dead_;[256] he\r\nrises first, the eldest brother, and he is my master in this science of\r\ndeath; but yet, for me, I am a younger brother too, to this man who\r\ndied now, and to every man whom I see or hear to die before me, and all\r\nthey are ushers to me in this school of death. I take therefore that\r\nwhich thy servant David's wife said to him, to be said to me, _If thou\r\nsave not thy life to-night, to-morrow thou shalt be slain_.[257] If the\r\ndeath of this man work not upon me now, I shall die worse than if thou\r\nhadst not afforded me this help; for thou hast sent him in this bell to\r\nme, as thou didst send to the angel of Sardis, with commission to\r\n_strengthen the things that remain, and that are ready to die_,[258]\r\nthat in this weakness of body I might receive spiritual strength by\r\nthese occasions. This is my strength, that whether thou say to me, as\r\nthine angel said to Gideon, _Peace be unto thee, fear not, thou shalt\r\nnot die_;[259] or whether thou say, as unto Aaron, _Thou shalt die\r\nthere_;[260] yet thou wilt preserve that which is ready to die, my soul,\r\nfrom the worst death, that of sin. Zimri _died for his sins_, says thy\r\nSpirit, _which he sinned in doing evil; and in his sin which he did to\r\nmake Israel sin_;[261] for his sins, his many sins, and then in his sin,\r\nhis particular sin. For my sins I shall die whensoever I die, for death\r\nis the wages of sin; but I shall die in my sin, in that particular sin\r\nof resisting thy Spirit, if I apply not thy assistances. Doth it not\r\ncall us to a particular consideration that thy blessed Son varies his\r\nform of commination, and aggravates it in the variation, when he says to\r\nthe Jews (because they refused the light offered), _You shall die in\r\nyour sin_:[262] and then when they proceeded to farther disputations,\r\nand vexations, and temptations, he adds, _You shall die in your\r\nsins_;[263] he multiplies the former expression to a plural. In this\r\nsin, and in all your sins, doth not the resisting of thy particular\r\nhelps at last draw upon us the guiltiness of all our former sins? May\r\nnot the neglecting of this sound ministered to me in this man's death,\r\nbring me to that misery, so that I, whom the Lord of life loved so as to\r\ndie for me, shall die, and a creature of mine own shall be immortal;\r\nthat I shall die, and the _worm_ of mine own conscience _shall never\r\ndie_?[264]\r", "bookID": "23772"}, {"text": "O eternal and most gracious God, I have a new occasion of thanks, and a\r\nnew occasion of prayer to thee from the ringing of this bell.

Thou presentest me death as the\r\ncure of my disease, not as the exaltation of it; if I mistake thy voice\r\nherein, if I overrun thy pace, and prevent thy hand, and imagine death\r\nmore instant upon me than thou hast bid him be, yet the voice belongs to\r\nme; I am dead, I was born dead, and from the first laying of these mud\r\nwalls in my conception, they have mouldered away, and the whole course\r\nof life is but an active death. Whether this voice instruct me that I am\r\na dead man now, or remember me that I have been a dead man all this\r\nwhile. I humbly thank thee for speaking in this voice to my soul; and I\r\nhumbly beseech thee also to accept my prayers in his behalf, by whose\r\noccasion this voice, this sound, is come to me. For though he be by\r\ndeath transplanted to thee, and so in possession of inexpressible\r\nhappiness there, yet here upon earth thou hast given us such a portion\r\nof heaven, as that though men dispute whether thy saints in heaven do\r\nknow what we in earth in particular do stand in need of, yet, without\r\nall disputation, we upon earth do know what thy saints in heaven lack\r\nyet for the consummation of their happiness, and therefore thou hast\r\nafforded us the dignity that we may pray for them. That therefore this\r\nsoul, now newly departed to thy kingdom, may quickly return to a joyful\r\nreunion to that body which it hath left, and that we with it may soon\r\nenjoy the full consummation of all in body and soul, I humbly beg at thy\r\nhand, O our most merciful God, for thy Son Christ Jesus' sake. That that\r\nblessed Son of thine may have the consummation of his dignity, by\r\nentering into his last office, the office of a judge, and may have\r\nsociety of human bodies in heaven, as well as he hath had ever of souls;\r\nand that as thou hatest sin itself, thy hate to sin may be expressed in\r\nthe abolishing of all instruments of sin, the allurements of this world,\r\nand the world itself; and all the temporary revenges of sin, the stings\r\nof sickness and of death; and all the castles, and prisons, and\r\nmonuments of sin, in the grave. That time may be swallowed up in\r\neternity, and hope swallowed in possession, and ends swallowed in\r\ninfiniteness, and all men ordained to salvation in body and soul be one\r\nentire and everlasting sacrifice to thee, where thou mayst receive\r\ndelight from them, and they glory from thee, for evermore.

Any disorder of\r\nmine, any pretermission of theirs, exalts the disease, accelerates the\r\nrages of it; no diligence accelerates the concoction, the maturity of\r\nthe disease; they must stay till the season of the sickness come; and\r\ntill it be ripened of itself, and then they may put to their hand to\r\ngather it before it fall off, but they cannot hasten the ripening. Why\r\nshould we look for it in a disease, which is the disorder, the discord,\r\nthe irregularity, the commotion and rebellion of the body? It were\r\nscarce a disease if it could be ordered and made obedient to our times.\r\nWhy should we look for that in disorder, in a disease, when we cannot\r\nhave it in nature, who is so regular and so pregnant, so forward to\r\nbring her work to perfection and to light? Yet we cannot awake the July\r\nflowers in January, nor retard the flowers of the spring to autumn. We\r\ncannot bid the fruits come in May, nor the leaves to stick on in\r\nDecember. A woman that is weak cannot put off her ninth month to a tenth\r\nfor her delivery, and say she will stay till she be stronger; nor a\r\nqueen cannot hasten it to a seventh, that she may be ready for some\r\nother pleasure. Nature (if we look for durable and vigorous effects)\r\nwill not admit preventions, nor anticipations, nor obligations upon her,\r\nfor they are precontracts, and she will be left to her liberty. Nature\r\nwould not be spurred, nor forced to mend her pace; nor power, the power\r\nof man, greatness, loves not that kind of violence neither. There are of\r\nthem that will give, that will do justice, that will pardon, but they\r\nhave their own seasons for all these, and he that knows not them shall\r\nstarve before that gift come, and ruin before the justice, and die\r\nbefore the pardon save him. Some tree bears no fruit, except much dung\r\nbe laid about it; and justice comes not from some till they be richly\r\nmanured: some trees require much visiting, much watering, much labour;\r\nand some men give not their fruits but upon importunity: some trees\r\nrequire incision, and pruning, and lopping; some men must be intimidated\r\nand syndicated with commissions, before they will deliver the fruits of\r\njustice: some trees require the early and the often access of the sun;\r\nsome men open not, but upon the favours and letters of court mediation:\r\nsome trees must be housed and kept within doors; some men lock up, not\r\nonly their liberality, but their justice and their compassion, till the\r\nsolicitation of a wife, or a son, or a friend, or a servant, turn the\r\nkey. Reward is the season of one man, and importunity of another; fear\r\nthe season of one man, and favour of another; friendship the season of\r\none man, and natural affection of another; and he that knows not their\r\nseasons, nor cannot stay them, must lose the fruits: as nature will not,\r\nso power and greatness will not be put to change their seasons, and\r\nshall we look for this indulgence in a disease, or think to shake it off\r\nbefore it be ripe? All this while, therefore, we are but upon a\r\ndefensive war, and that is but a doubtful state; especially where they\r\nwho are besieged do know the best of their defences, and do not know\r\nthe worst of their enemy's power; when they cannot mend their works\r\nwithin, and the enemy can increase his numbers without. O how many far\r\nmore miserable, and far more worthy to be less miserable than I, are\r\nbesieged with this sickness, and lack their sentinels, their physicians\r\nto watch, and lack their munition, their cordials to defend, and perish\r\nbefore the enemy's weakness might invite them to sally, before the\r\ndisease show any declination, or admit any way of working upon itself?\r\nIn me the siege is so far slackened, as that we may come to fight, and\r\nso die in the field, if I die, and not in a prison.\r", "bookID": "23772"}, {"text": "My God, my God, thou art a direct God, may I not say a literal God, a\r\nGod that wouldst be understood literally and according to the plain\r\nsense of all that thou sayest? but thou art also (Lord, I intend it to\r\nthy glory, and let no profane misinterpreter abuse it to thy\r\ndiminution), thou art a figurative, a metaphorical God too; a God in\r\nwhose words there is such a height of figures, such voyages, such\r\nperegrinations to fetch remote and precious metaphors, such extensions,\r\nsuch spreadings, such curtains of allegories, such third heavens of\r\nhyperboles, so harmonious elocutions, so retired and so reserved\r\nexpressions, so commanding persuasions, so persuading commandments, such\r\nsinews even in thy milk, and such things in thy words, as all profane\r\nauthors seem of the seed of the serpent that creeps, thou art the Dove\r\nthat flies. O, what words but thine can express the inexpressible\r\ntexture and composition of thy word, in which to one man that argument\r\nthat binds his faith to believe that to be the word of God, is the\r\nreverent simplicity of the word, and to another the majesty of the word;\r\nand in which two men equally pious may meet, and one wonder that all\r\nshould not understand it, and the other as much that any man should. So,\r\nLord, thou givest us the same earth to labour on and to lie in, a house\r\nand a grave of the same earth; so, Lord, thou givest us the same word\r\nfor our satisfaction and for our inquisition, for our instruction and\r\nfor our admiration too; for there are places that thy servants Hierom\r\nand Augustine would scarce believe (when they grew warm by mutual\r\nletters) of one another, that they understood them, and yet both Hierom\r\nand Augustine call upon persons whom they knew to be far weaker than\r\nthey thought one another (old women and young maids) to read the\r\nScriptures, without confining them to these or those places. Neither art\r\nthou thus a figurative, a metaphorical God in thy word only, but in thy\r\nworks too. The style of thy works, the phrase of thine actions, is\r\nmetaphorical The institution of thy whole worship in the old law was a\r\ncontinual allegory; types and figures overspread all, and figures flowed\r\ninto figures, and poured themselves out into farther figures;\r\ncircumcision carried a figure of baptism, and baptism carries a figure\r\nof that purity which we shall have in perfection in the new Jerusalem.\r\nNeither didst thou speak and work in this language only in the time of\r\nthy prophets; but since thou spokest in thy Son it is so too. How often,\r\nhow much more often, doth thy Son call himself a way, and a light, and a\r\ngate, and a vine, and bread, than the Son of God, or of man? How much\r\noftener doth he exhibit a metaphorical Christ, than a real, a literal?\r\nThis hath occasioned thine ancient servants, whose delight it was to\r\nwrite after thy copy, to proceed the same way in their expositions of\r\nthe Scriptures, and in their composing both of public liturgies and of\r\nprivate prayers to thee, to make their accesses to thee in such a kind\r\nof language as thou wast pleased to speak to them, in a figurative, in a\r\nmetaphorical language, in which manner I am bold to call the comfort\r\nwhich I receive now in this sickness in the indication of the concoction\r\nand maturity thereof, in certain clouds and recidences, which the\r\nphysicians observe, a discovering of land from sea after a long and\r\ntempestuous voyage. But wherefore, O my God, hast thou presented to us\r\nthe afflictions and calamities of this life in the name of waters? so\r\noften in the name of waters, and deep waters, and seas of waters? Must\r\nwe look to be drowned? are they bottomless, are they boundless? That is\r\nnot the dialect of thy language; thou hast given a remedy against the\r\ndeepest water by water; against the inundation of sin by baptism; and\r\nthe first life that thou gavest to any creatures was in waters:\r\ntherefore thou dost not threaten us with an irremediableness when our\r\naffliction is a sea. It is so if we consider ourselves; so thou callest\r\nGenezareth, which was but a lake, and not salt, a sea; so thou callest\r\nthe Mediterranean sea still the great sea, because the inhabitants saw\r\nno other sea; they that dwelt there thought a lake a sea, and the others\r\nthought a little sea, the greatest, and we that know not the afflictions\r\nof others call our own the heaviest. But, O my God, that is truly great\r\nthat overflows the channel, that is really a great affliction which is\r\nabove my strength; but thou, O God, art my strength, and then what can\r\nbe above it? _Mountains shake with the swelling of thy sea_;[265]\r\nsecular mountains, men strong in power; spiritual mountains, men strong\r\nin grace, are shaken with afflictions; but _thou layest up thy sea in\r\nstorehouses_;[266] even thy corrections are of thy treasure, and thou\r\nwilt not waste thy corrections; when they have done their service to\r\nhumble thy patient, thou wilt call them in again, for _thou givest the\r\nsea thy decree, that the waters should not pass thy commandment_.[267]\r\nAll our waters shall run into Jordan, and thy servants passed Jordan dry\r\nfoot;[268] they shall run into the red sea (the sea of thy Son's blood),\r\nand the red sea, that red sea, drowns none of thine: but _they that sail\r\non the sea tell of the danger thereof_.[269] I that am yet in this\r\naffliction, owe thee the glory of speaking of it; but, as the wise man\r\nbids me, I say, I _may speak much and come short, wherefore in sum thou\r\nart all_.[270] Since thou art so, O my God, and affliction is a sea too\r\ndeep for us, what is our refuge? Thine ark, thy ship. In all other\r\nafflictions, those means which thou hast ordained in this sea, in\r\nsickness, thy ship is thy physician. _Thou hast made a way in the sea,\r\nand a safe path in the waters, showing that thou canst save from all\r\ndangers, yea, though a man went to sea without art_:[271] yet, where I\r\nfind all that, I find this added; _nevertheless thou wouldst not, that\r\nthe work of thy wisdom should be idle_.[272] Thou canst save without\r\nmeans, but thou hast told no man that thou wilt; thou hast told every\r\nman that thou wilt not.[273] When the centurion believed the master of\r\nthe ship more than St. Paul, they were all opened to a great danger;\r\nthis was a preferring of thy means before thee, the author of the means:\r\nbut, my God, though thou beest every where: I have no promise of\r\nappearing to me but in thy ship, thy blessed Son preached out of a\r\nship:[274] the means is preaching, he did that; and the ship was a type\r\nof the church, he did it there. Thou gavest St. Paul the lives of all\r\nthem that sailed with him;[275] if they had not been in the ship with\r\nhim, the gift had not extended to them. _As soon as thy Son was come out\r\nof the ship, immediately there met him, out of the tombs, a man with an\r\nunclean spirit, and no man could hold him, no not with chains._[276] Thy\r\nSon needed no use of means; yet there we apprehend the danger to us, if\r\nwe leave the ship, the means, in this case the physician. But as they\r\nare ships to us in those seas, so is there a ship to them too in which\r\nthey are to stay. Give me leave, O my God, to assist myself with such a\r\nconstruction of these words of thy servant Paul to the centurion, when\r\nthe mariners would have left the ship, _Except these abide in the ship,\r\nyou cannot be safe_:[277] except they who are our ships, the physicians,\r\nabide in that which is theirs, and our ship, the truth, and the sincere\r\nand religious worship of thee and thy gospel, we cannot promise\r\nourselves so good safety; for though we have our ship, the physician, he\r\nhath not his ship, religion; and means are not means but in their\r\nconcatenation, as they depend and are chained together. _The ships are\r\ngreat_, says thy apostle, _but a helm turns them_;[278] the men are\r\nlearned, but their religion turns their labours to good, and therefore\r\nit was a heavy curse when _the third part of the ships perished_:[279]\r\nit is a heavy case where either all religion, or true religion, should\r\nforsake many of these ships whom thou hast sent to convey us over these\r\nseas. But, O my God, my God, since I have my ship and they theirs, I\r\nhave them and they have thee, why are we yet no nearer land? As soon as\r\nthy Son's disciple had taken him into the ship, _immediately the ship\r\nwas at the land whither they went_.[280] Why have not they and I this\r\ndispatch? Every thing is immediately done, which is done when thou\r\nwouldst have it done. Thy purpose terminates every action, and what was\r\ndone before that is undone yet. Shall that slacken my hope? thy prophet\r\nfrom thee hath forbidden it. _It is good that a man should both hope,\r\nand quietly wait for the salvation of the Lord._[281] Thou puttest off\r\nmany judgments till the last day, and many pass this life without any;\r\nand shall not I endure the putting off thy mercy for a day? And yet, O\r\nmy God, thou puttest me not to that, for the assurance of future mercy\r\nis present mercy. But what is my assurance now? what is my seal? It is\r\nbut a cloud; that which my physicians call a cloud, in that which gives\r\nthem their indication. But a cloud? Thy great seal to all the world, the\r\nrainbow, that secured the world for ever from drowning, was but a\r\nreflection upon a cloud. A cloud itself was a pillar which guided the\r\nchurch,[282] and the glory of God not only was, but appeared in a\r\ncloud.[283] Let me return, O my God, to the consideration of thy servant\r\nElijah's proceeding in a time of desperate drought;[284] he bids them\r\nlook towards the sea; they look, and see nothing. He bids them again and\r\nagain seven times; and at the seventh time they saw a little cloud\r\nrising out of the sea, and presently they had their desire of rain.\r\nSeven days, O my God, have we looked for this cloud, and now we have it;\r\nnone of thy indications are frivolous, thou makest thy signs seals, and\r\nthy seals effects, and thy effects consolation and restitution,\r\nwheresoever thou mayst receive glory by that way.\r", "bookID": "23772"}, {"text": "O eternal and most gracious God, who though thou passedst over infinite\r\nmillions of generations, before thou camest to a creation of this world,\r\nyet when thou beganst, didst never intermit that work, but continuedst\r\nday to day, till thou hadst perfected all the work, and deposed it in\r\nthe hands and rest of a sabbath, though thou have been pleased to\r\nglorify thyself in a long exercise of my patience, with an expectation\r\nof thy declaration of thyself in this my sickness, yet since thou hast\r\nnow of thy goodness afforded that which affords us some hope, if that be\r\nstill the way of thy glory, proceed in that way and perfect that work,\r\nand establish me in a sabbath and rest in thee, by this thy seal of\r\nbodily restitution. Thy priests came up to thee by steps in the temple;\r\nthy angels came down to Jacob by steps upon the ladder; we find no stair\r\nby which thou thyself camest to Adam in paradise, nor to Sodom in thine\r\nanger; for thou, and thou only, art able to do all at once. But O Lord,\r\nI am not weary of thy pace, nor weary of mine own patience. I provoke\r\nthee not with a prayer, not with a wish, not with a hope, to more haste\r\nthan consists with thy purpose, nor look that any other thing should\r\nhave entered into thy purpose, but thy glory.

Counsels are not\r\nalways determined in resolutions, we cannot always say, this was\r\nconcluded; actions are always determined in effects, we can say, this\r\nwas done. Then have laws their reverence and their majesty, when we see\r\nthe judge upon the bench executing them. Then have counsels of war\r\ntheir impressions and their operations, when we see the seal of an army\r\nset to them. It was an ancient way of celebrating the memory of such as\r\ndeserved well of the state, to afford them that kind of statuary\r\nrepresentation, which was then called Hermes, which was the head and\r\nshoulders of a man standing upon a cube, but those shoulders without\r\narms and hands. Altogether it figured a constant supporter of the state,\r\nby his counsel; but in this hieroglyphic, which they made without hands,\r\nthey pass their consideration no farther but that the counsellor should\r\nbe without hands, so far as not to reach out his hand to foreign\r\ntemptations of bribes, in matters of counsel, and that it was not\r\nnecessary that the head should employ his own hand; that the same men\r\nshould serve in the execution which assisted in the counsel; but that\r\nthere should not belong hands to every head, action to every counsel,\r\nwas never intended so much as in figure and representation. For as\r\nmatrimony is scarce to be called matrimony where there is a resolution\r\nagainst the fruits of matrimony, against the having of children,[285] so\r\ncounsels are not counsels, but illusions, where there is from the\r\nbeginning no purpose to execute the determinations of those counsels.\r\nThe arts and sciences are most properly referred to the head; that is\r\ntheir proper element and sphere; but yet the art of proving, logic, and\r\nthe art of persuading, rhetoric, are deduced to the hand, and that\r\nexpressed by a hand contracted into a fist, and this by a hand enlarged\r\nand expanded; and evermore the power of man, and the power of God,\r\nhimself is expressed so. All things are in his hand; neither is God so\r\noften presented to us, by names that carry our consideration upon\r\ncounsel, as upon execution of counsel; he oftener is called the Lord of\r\nHosts than by all other names, that may be referred to the other\r\nsignification.

But because it is easily said, I\r\nbelieve, and because it doth not easily lie in proof, nor is easily\r\ndemonstrable by any evidence taken from my heart (for who sees that, who\r\nsearches those rolls?) whether I do believe or no, is it not therefore,\r\nO my God, that thou dost so frequently, so earnestly, refer us to the\r\nhand, to the observation of actions? There is a little suspicion, a\r\nlittle imputation laid upon over-tedious and dilatory counsels. Many\r\ngood occasions slip away in long consultations; and it may be a degree\r\nof sloth, to be too long in mending nets, though that must be done. _He\r\nthat observeth the wind shall not sow, and he that regardeth the clouds\r\nshall not reap_;[286] that is, he that is too dilatory, too\r\nsuperstitious in these observations, and studies but the excuse of his\r\nown idleness in them; but that which the same wise and royal servant of\r\nthine says in another place, all accept, and ask no comment upon it, _He\r\nbecometh poor that dealeth with a slack hand, but the hand of the\r\ndiligent maketh rich_;[287] all evil imputed to the absence, all good\r\nattributed to the presence of the hand. I know, my God (and I bless thy\r\nname for knowing it, for all good knowledge is from thee), that thou\r\nconsiderest the heart; but thou takest not off thine eye till thou come\r\nto the hand. Nay, my God, doth not thy Spirit intimate that thou\r\nbeginnest where we begin (at least, that thou allowest us to begin\r\nthere), when thou orderest thine own answer to thine own question, _Who\r\nshall ascend into the hill of the Lord_? thus, _He that hath clean\r\nhands, and a pure heart_?[288] Dost thou not (at least) send us first to\r\nthe hand? And is not the work of their hands that declaration of their\r\nholy zeal, in the present execution of manifest idolators, called a\r\nconsecration of themselves,[289] by thy Holy Spirit? Their hands are\r\ncalled all themselves; for even counsel itself goes under that name in\r\nthy word, who knowest best how to give right names: because the counsel\r\nof the priests assisted David,[290] Saul says the hand of the priest is\r\nwith David. And that which is often said by Moses, is very often\r\nrepeated by thy other prophets, _These and these things the Lord\r\nspake_,[291] and _the Lord said_, and _the Lord commanded_, not by the\r\ncounsels, not by the voice, but by the _hand of Moses_, and by the _hand\r\nof the prophets_. Evermore we are referred for our evidence of others,\r\nand of ourselves, to the hand, to action, to works. There is something\r\nbefore it, believing; and there is something after it, suffering; but in\r\nthe most eminent, and obvious, and conspicuous place stands doing. Why\r\nthen, O my God, my blessed God, in the ways of my spiritual strength,\r\ncome I so slow to action? I was whipped by thy rod, before I came to\r\nconsultation, to consider my state; and shall I go no farther? As he\r\nthat would describe a circle in paper, if he have brought that circle\r\nwithin one inch of finishing, yet if he remove his compass he cannot\r\nmake it up a perfect circle except he fall to work again, to find out\r\nthe same centre, so, though setting that foot of my compass upon thee, I\r\nhave gone so far as to the consideration of myself, yet if I depart from\r\nthee, my centre, all is imperfect. This proceeding to action, therefore,\r\nis a returning to thee, and a working upon myself by thy physic, by thy\r\npurgative physic, a free and entire evacuation of my soul by confession.\r\nThe working of purgative physic is violent and contrary to nature. O\r\nLord, I decline not this potion of confession, however it may be\r\ncontrary to a natural man. To take physic, and not according to the\r\nright method, is dangerous.[292] O Lord, I decline not that method in\r\nthis physic, in things that burthen my conscience, to make my confession\r\nto him, into whose hands thou hast put the power of absolution.

How many men are\r\nraised, and then do not fill the place they are raised to? No corner of\r\nany place can be empty; there can be no vacuity. If that man do not fill\r\nthe place, other men will; complaints of his insufficiency will fill it;\r\nnay, such an abhorring is there in nature of vacuity, that if there be\r\nbut an imagination of not filling, in any man, that which is but\r\nimagination, neither will fill it, that is, rumour and voice, and it\r\nwill be given out (upon no ground but imagination, and no man knows\r\nwhose imagination), that he is corrupt in his place, or insufficient in\r\nhis place, and another prepared to succeed him in his place.

This resurrection of my\r\nbody shows me the resurrection of my soul; and both here severally, of\r\nboth together hereafter. Since thy martyrs under the altar press thee\r\nwith their solicitation for the resurrection of the body to glory, thou\r\nwouldst pardon me, if I should press thee by prayer for the\r\naccomplishing of this resurrection, which thou hast begun in me, to\r\nhealth. But, O my God, I do not ask, where I might ask amiss, nor beg\r\nthat which perchance might be worse for me. I have a bed of sin; delight\r\nin sin is a bed: I have a grave of sin; senselessness of sin is a grave:\r\nand where Lazarus had been four days, I have been fifty years in this\r\nputrefaction; why dost thou not call me, as thou didst him, _with a loud\r\nvoice_,[297] since my soul is as dead as his body was? I need thy\r\nthunder, O my God; thy music will not serve me. Thou hast called thy\r\nservants, who are to work upon us in thine ordinance, by all these loud\r\nnames--winds, and chariots, and falls of waters; where thou wouldst be\r\nheard, thou wilt be heard. When thy Son concurred with thee to the\r\nmaking of man, there it is but a speaking, but a saying. There, O\r\nblessed and glorious Trinity, was none to hear but you three, and you\r\neasily hear one another, because you say the same things. But when thy\r\nSon came to the work of redemption, thou spokest,[298] and they that\r\nheard it took it for thunder; and thy Son himself cried with a loud\r\nvoice upon the cross twice,[299] as he who was to prepare his coming,\r\nJohn Baptist, was the voice of a crier, and not of a whisperer. Still,\r\nif it be thy voice, it is a loud voice. _These words_, says thy Moses,\r\n_thou spokest with a great voice, and thou addedst no more_,[300] says\r\nhe there. That which thou hast said is evident, and it is evident that\r\nnone can speak so loud; none can bind us to hear him, as we must thee.\r\n_The Most High uttered his voice._ What was his voice? _The Lord\r\nthundered from heaven_,[301] it might be heard; but this voice, thy\r\nvoice, is also a _mighty voice_;[302] not only mighty in power, it may\r\nbe heard, nor mighty in obligation, it should be heard; but mighty in\r\noperation, it will be heard; and therefore hast thou bestowed a whole\r\npsalm[303] upon us, to lead us to the consideration of thy voice. It is\r\nsuch a voice as that thy Son says, _the dead shall hear it_;[304] and\r\nthat is my state. And why, O God, dost thou not speak to me, in that\r\neffectual loudness? Saint John heard a voice, and _he turned about to\r\nsee the voice_:[305] sometimes we are too curious of the instrument by\r\nwhat man God speaks; but thou speakest loudest when thou speakest to the\r\nheart. _There was silence, and I heard a voice_, says one, to thy\r\nservant Job.[306] I hearken after thy voice in thine ordinances, and I\r\nseek not a whispering in conventicles; but yet, O my God, speak louder,\r\nthat so, though I do hear thee now, then I may hear nothing but thee. My\r\nsins cry aloud; Cain's murder did so: my afflictions cry aloud; _the\r\nfloods have lifted up their voice_ (and waters are afflictions), _but\r\nthou, O Lord, art mightier than the voice of many waters_;[307] than\r\nmany temporal, many spiritual afflictions, than any of either kind: and\r\nwhy dost thou not speak to me in that voice? _What is man, and whereto\r\nserveth he? What is his good and what is his evil?_[308] My bed of sin\r\nis not evil, not desperately evil, for thou dost call me out of it; but\r\nmy rising out of it is not good (not perfectly good), if thou call not\r\nlouder, and hold me now I am up. O my God, I am afraid of a fearful\r\napplication of those words, _When a man hath done, then he\r\nbeginneth_;[309] when this body is unable to sin, his sinful memory sins\r\nover his old sins again; and that which thou wouldst have us to remember\r\nfor compunction, we remember with delight. _Bring him to me in his bed,\r\nthat I may kill him_,[310] says Saul of David: thou hast not said so,\r\nthat is not thy voice. Joash's own servants slew him when he was sick\r\nin his bed:[311] thou hast not suffered that, that my servants should so\r\nmuch as neglect me, or be weary of me in my sickness. Thou threatenest,\r\nthat _as a shepherd takes out of the mouth of the lion two legs, or a\r\npiece of an ear, so shall the children of Israel, that dwell in Samaria,\r\nin the corner of a bed, and in Damascus, in a couch, be taken\r\naway_;[312] and even they that are secure from danger shall perish. How\r\nmuch more might I, who was in the bed of death, die? But thou hast not\r\nso dealt with me. As they brought out sick persons in beds, that thy\r\nservant Peter's shadow might over-shadow them,[313] thou hast, O my God,\r\nover-shadowed me, refreshed me; but when wilt thou do more? When wilt\r\nthou do all? When wilt thou speak in thy loud voice? When wilt thou bid\r\nme _take up my bed and walk_?[314] As my bed is my affections, when\r\nshall I bear them so as to subdue them? As my bed is my afflictions,\r\nwhen shall I bear them so as not to murmur at them? When shall I take up\r\nmy bed and walk? Not lie down upon it, as it is my pleasure, not sink\r\nunder it, as it is my correction?

How dear, and how often a rent doth man pay for his farm!\r\nHe pays twice a day, in double meals, and how little time he hath to\r\nraise his rent! How many holidays to call him from his labour! Every day\r\nis half holiday, half spent in sleep. What reparations, and subsidies,\r\nand contributions he is put to, besides his rent! What medicines besides\r\nhis diet; and what inmates he is fain to take in, besides his own\r\nfamily; what infectious diseases from other men! Adam might have had\r\nParadise for dressing and keeping it; and then his rent was not improved\r\nto such a labour as would have made his brow sweat; and yet he gave it\r\nover; how far greater a rent do we pay for this farm, this body, who pay\r\nourselves, who pay the farm itself, and cannot live upon it! Neither is\r\nour labour at an end when we have cut down some weed as soon as it\r\nsprung up, corrected some violent and dangerous accident of a disease\r\nwhich would have destroyed speedily, nor when we have pulled up that\r\nweed from the very root, recovered entirely and soundly from that\r\nparticular disease; but the whole ground is of an ill nature, the whole\r\nsoil ill disposed; there are inclinations, there is a propenseness to\r\ndiseases in the body, out of which, without any other disorder, diseases\r\nwill grow, and so we are put to a continual labour upon this farm, to a\r\ncontinual study of the whole complexion and constitution of our body. In\r\nthe distempers and diseases of soils, sourness, dryness, weeping, any\r\nkind of barrenness, the remedy and the physic is, for a great part,\r\nsometimes in themselves; sometimes the very situation relieves them; the\r\nhanger of a hill will purge and vent his own malignant moisture, and the\r\nburning of the upper turf of some ground (as health from cauterizing)\r\nputs a new and a vigorous youth into that soil, and there rises a kind\r\nof phoenix out of the ashes, a fruitfulness out of that which was\r\nbarren before, and by that which is the barrenest of all, ashes. And\r\nwhere the ground cannot give itself physic, yet it receives physic from\r\nother grounds, from other soils, which are not the worse for having\r\ncontributed that help to them from marl in other hills, or from slimy\r\nsand in other shores, grounds help themselves, or hurt not other grounds\r\nfrom whence they receive help. But I have taken a farm at this hard\r\nrent, and upon those heavy covenants, that it can afford itself no help\r\n(no part of my body, if it were cut off, would cure another part; in\r\nsome cases it might preserve a sound part, but in no case recover an\r\ninfected); and if my body may have had any physic, any medicine from\r\nanother body, one man from the flesh of another man (as by mummy, or any\r\nsuch composition), it must be from a man that is dead, and not as in\r\nother soils, which are never the worse for contributing their marl or\r\ntheir fat slime to my ground. There is nothing in the same man to help\r\nman, nothing in mankind to help one another (in this sort, by way of\r\nphysic), but that he who ministers the help is in as ill case as he that\r\nreceives it would have been if he had not had it; for he from whose body\r\nthe physic comes is dead. When therefore I took this farm, undertook\r\nthis body, I undertook to drain not a marsh but a moat, where there was,\r\nnot water mingled to offend, but all was water; I undertook to perfume\r\ndung, where no one part but all was equally unsavoury; I undertook to\r\nmake such a thing wholesome, as was not poison by any manifest quality,\r\nintense heat or cold, but poison in the whole substance, and in the\r\nspecific form of it. To cure the sharp accidents of diseases is a great\r\nwork; to cure the disease itself is a greater; but to cure the body,\r\nthe root, the occasion of diseases, is a work reserved for the great\r\nphysician, which he doth never any other way but by glorifying these\r\nbodies in the next world.\r", "bookID": "23772"}, {"text": "My God, my God, what am I put to when I am put to consider and put off\r\nthe root, the fuel, the occasion of my sickness?

The whole world is a pile\r\nof fagots, upon which we are laid, and (as though there were no other)\r\nwe are the bellows. Ignorance blows the fire. He that touched any\r\nunclean thing, though he knew it not, became unclean,[315] and a\r\nsacrifice was required (therefore a sin imputed), though it were done in\r\nignorance.[316] Ignorance blows this coal; but then knowledge much more;\r\nfor there are that _know thy judgments, and yet not only do, but have\r\npleasure in others that do against them_.[317] Nature blows this coal;\r\n_by nature we are the children of wrath_;[318] and the law blows it; thy\r\napostle Saint Paul found that _sin took occasion by the law_, that\r\ntherefore, because it is forbidden, we do some things. If we break the\r\nlaw, we sin; _sin is the transgression of the law_;[319] and sin itself\r\nbecomes a law in our members.[320] Our fathers have imprinted the seed,\r\ninfused a spring of sin in us. _As a fountain casteth out her waters_,\r\nwe _cast out our wickedness_, but _we have done worse than our\r\nfathers_.[321] We are open to infinite temptations, and yet, as though\r\nwe lacked, we are tempted of our own lusts.[322] And not satisfied with\r\nthat, as though we were not powerful enough, or cunning enough, to\r\ndemolish or undermine ourselves, when we ourselves have no pleasure in\r\nthe sin, we sin for others' sakes. When Adam sinned for Eve's sake,[323]\r\nand Solomon to gratify his wives,[324] it was an uxorious sin; when the\r\njudges sinned for Jezebel's sake,[325] and Joab to obey David,[326] it\r\nwas an ambitious sin; when Pilate sinned to humour the people,[327] and\r\nHerod to give farther contentment to the Jews,[328] it was a popular\r\nsin. Any thing serves to occasion sin, at home in my bosom, or abroad in\r\nmy mark and aim; that which I am, and that which I am not, that which I\r\nwould be, proves coals, and embers, and fuel, and bellows to sin; and\r\ndost thou put me, O my God, to discharge myself of myself, before I can\r\nbe well?

Even in pleasures and in pains, there is a\r\nproprietary, a _meum et tuum_, and a man is most affected with that\r\npleasure which is his, his by former enjoying and experience, and most\r\nintimidated with those pains which are his, his by a woful sense of\r\nthem, in former afflictions. A covetous person, who hath preoccupated\r\nall his senses, filled all his capacities with the delight of gathering,\r\nwonders how any man can have any taste of any pleasure in any openness\r\nor liberality; so also in bodily pains, in a fit of the stone, the\r\npatient wonders why any man should call the gout a pain; and he that\r\nhath felt neither, but the toothache, is as much afraid of a fit of that\r\nas either of the other of either of the other. Diseases which we never\r\nfelt in ourselves come but to a compassion of others that have endured\r\nthem; nay, compassion itself comes to no great degree if we have not\r\nfelt in some proportion in ourselves that which we lament and condole in\r\nanother. But when we have had those torments in their exaltation\r\nourselves, we tremble at relapse. When we must pant through all those\r\nfiery heats, and sail through all those overflowing sweats, when we must\r\nwatch through all those long nights, and mourn through all those long\r\ndays (days and nights, so long as that Nature herself shall seem to be\r\nperverted, and to have put the longest day, and the longest night, which\r\nshould be six months asunder, into one natural, unnatural day), when we\r\nmust stand at the same bar, expect the return of physicians from their\r\nconsultations, and not be sure of the same verdict, in any good\r\nindications, when we must go the same way over again, and not see the\r\nsame issue, that is a state, a condition, a calamity, in respect of\r\nwhich any other sickness were a convalescence, and any greater, less. It\r\nadds to the affliction, that relapses are (and for the most part justly)\r\nimputed to ourselves, as occasioned by some disorder in us; and so we\r\nare not only passive but active in our own ruin; we do not only stand\r\nunder a falling house, but pull it down upon us; and we are not only\r\nexecuted (that implies guiltiness), but we are executioners (that\r\nimplies dishonour), and executioners of ourselves (and that implies\r\nimpiety). And we fall from that comfort which we might have in our first\r\nsickness, from that meditation, \"Alas, how generally miserable is man,\r\nand how subject to diseases\" (for in that it is some degree of comfort\r\nthat we are but in the state common to all), we fall, I say, to this\r\ndiscomfort, and self-accusing, and self-condemning: \"Alas, how\r\nimprovident, and in that how unthankful to God and his instruments, am I\r\nin making so ill use of so great benefits, in destroying so soon so long\r\na work, in relapsing, by my disorder, to that from which they had\r\ndelivered me\": and so my meditation is fearfully transferred from the\r\nbody to the mind, and from the consideration of the sickness to that\r\nsin, that sinful carelessness, by which I have occasioned my relapse.\r\nAnd amongst the many weights that aggravate a relapse, this also is one,\r\nthat a relapse proceeds with a more violent dispatch, and more\r\nirremediably, because it finds the country weakened, and depopulated\r\nbefore. Upon a sickness, which as yet appears not, we can scarce fix a\r\nfear, because we know not what to fear; but as fear is the busiest and\r\nirksomest affection, so is a relapse (which is still ready to come) into\r\nthat which is but newly gone, the nearest object, the most immediate\r\nexercise of that affection of fear.\r", "bookID": "23772"}, {"text": "My God, my God, my God, thou mighty Father, who hast been my physician;\r\nthou glorious Son, who hast been my physic; thou blessed Spirit, who\r\nhast prepared and applied all to me, shall I alone be able to overthrow\r\nthe work of all you, and relapse into those spiritual sicknesses from\r\nwhich infinite mercies have withdrawn me? Though thou, O my God, have\r\nfilled my measure with mercy, yet my measure was not so large as that of\r\nthy whole people, the nation, the numerous and glorious nation of\r\nIsrael; and yet how often, how often did they fall into relapses! And\r\nthen, where is my assurance? How easily thou passedst over many other\r\nsins in them, and how vehemently thou insistedst in those into which\r\nthey so often relapsed; those were their murmurings against thee, in\r\nthine instruments and ministers, and their turnings upon other gods, and\r\nembracing the idolatries of their neighbours. O my God, how slippery a\r\nway, to how irrecoverable a bottom, is murmuring; and how near thyself\r\nhe comes, that murmurs at him who comes from thee! The magistrate is the\r\ngarment in which thou apparelest thyself, and he that shoots at the\r\nclothes cannot say he meant no ill to the man: thy people were fearful\r\nexamples of that, for how often did their murmuring against thy\r\nministers end in a departing from thee! When they would have other\r\nofficers, they would have other gods; and still to-day's murmuring was\r\nto-morrow's idolatry; as their murmuring induced idolatry, and they\r\nrelapsed often into both, I have found in myself, O my God (O my God,\r\nthou hast found it in me, and thy finding it hast showed it to me) such\r\na transmigration of sin, as makes me afraid of relapsing too. The soul\r\nof sin (for we have made sin immortal, and it must have a soul), the\r\nsoul of sin is disobedience to thee; and when one sin hath been dead in\r\nme, that soul hath passed into another sin. Our youth dies, and the sins\r\nof our youth with it; some sins die a violent death, and some a natural;\r\npoverty, penury, imprisonment, banishment, kill some sins in us, and\r\nsome die of age; many ways we become unable to do that sin, but still\r\nthe soul lives and passes into another sin; and that that was\r\nlicentiousness grows ambition, and that comes to indevotion and\r\nspiritual coldness: we have three lives in our state of sin, and where\r\nthe sins of youth expire, those of our middle years enter, and those of\r\nour age after them. This transmigration of sin found in myself, makes me\r\nafraid, O my God, of a relapse; but the occasion of my fear is more\r\npregnant than so, for I have had, I have multiplied relapses already.\r\nWhy, O my God, is a relapse so odious to thee? Not so much their\r\nmurmuring and their idolatry, as their relapsing into those sins, seems\r\nto affect thee in thy disobedient people. _They limited the holy One of\r\nIsrael_,[331] as thou complainest of them: that was a murmuring; but\r\nbefore thou chargest them with the fault itself, in the same place thou\r\nchargest them with the iterating, the redoubling of that fault before\r\nthe fault was named; _How oft did they provoke me in the wilderness, and\r\ngrieve me in the desert?_ That which brings thee to that exasperation\r\nagainst them, as to say, that thou wouldst break thine own oath rather\r\nthan leave them unpunished (_They shall not see the land which I sware\r\nunto their fathers_) was because _they had tempted thee ten times_,[332]\r\ninfinitely; upon that thou threatenest with that vehemency, _If you do\r\nin any wise go back, know for a certainty God will no more drive out any\r\nof these nations from before you; but they shall be snares and traps\r\nunto you, and scourges in your sides, and thorns in your eyes, till ye\r\nperish_.[333] No tongue but thine own, O my God, can express thine\r\nindignation against a nation relapsing to idolatry. Idolatry in any\r\nnation is deadly, but when the disease is complicated with a relapse (a\r\nknowledge and a profession of a former recovery), it is desperate; and\r\nthine anger works, not only where the evidence is pregnant and without\r\nexception (so thou sayest when it is said, that certain men in a city\r\nhave withdrawn others to idolatry, and that inquiry is made, and it is\r\nfound true; the city, and the inhabitants, and the cattle are to be\r\ndestroyed),[334] but where there is but a suspicion, a rumour, of such a\r\nrelapse to idolatry, thine anger is awakened, and thine indignation\r\nstirred. In the government of thy servant Joshua, there was a voice,\r\nthat Reuben and Gad, with those of Manasseh, had built a new altar.[335]\r\nIsrael doth not send one to inquire, but the whole congregation gathered\r\nto go up to war against them,[336] and there went a prince of every\r\ntribe; and they object to them, not so much their present declination to\r\nidolatry, as their relapse: _Is the iniquity of Peor too little for\r\nus?_[337] an idolatry formerly committed, and punished with the\r\nslaughter of twenty-four thousand delinquents. At last Reuben and Gad\r\nsatisfy them, that that altar was not built for idolatry, but built as a\r\npattern of theirs, that they might thereby profess themselves to be of\r\nthe same profession that they were, and so the army returned without\r\nblood. Even where it comes not so far as to an actual relapse into\r\nidolatry, thou, O my God, becomest sensible of it; though thou, who\r\nseest the heart all the way, preventest all dangerous effects where\r\nthere was no ill meaning, however there were occasion of suspicious\r\nrumours given to thine Israel of relapsing. So odious to thee, and so\r\naggravating a weight upon sin is a relapse. But, O my God, why is it so?\r\nso odious? It must be so, because he that hath sinned and then repented,\r\nhath weighed God and the devil in a balance; he hath heard God and the\r\ndevil plead, and after hearing given judgment on that side to which he\r\nadheres by his subsequent practice;[338] if he return to his sin, he\r\ndecrees for Satan, he prefers sin before grace, and Satan before God;\r\nand in contempt of God, declares the precedency for his adversary; and a\r\ncontempt wounds deeper than an injury, a relapse deeper than a\r\nblasphemy. And when thou hast told me that a relapse is more odious to\r\nthee, need I ask why it is more dangerous, more pernicious to me? Is\r\nthere any other measure of the greatness of my danger, than the\r\ngreatness of thy displeasure? How fitly and how fearfully hast thou\r\nexpressed my case in a storm at sea, if I relapse; _They mount up to\r\nheaven, and they go down again to the depth_![339] My sickness brought\r\nme to thee in repentance, and my relapse hath cast me farther from thee.\r\n_The end of that man shall be worse than the beginning_,[340] says thy\r\nWord, thy Son; my beginning was sickness, punishment for sin: but _a\r\nworse thing may follow_,[341] says he also, if I sin again; not only\r\ndeath, which is an end worse than sickness, which was the beginning, but\r\nhell, which is a beginning worse than that end. Thy great servant\r\ndenied thy Son,[342] and he denied him again, but all before repentance;\r\nhere was no relapse. O, if thou hadst ever readmitted Adam into\r\nParadise, how abstinently would he have walked by that tree! And would\r\nnot the angels that fell have fixed themselves upon thee, if thou hadst\r\nonce readmitted them to thy sight? They never relapsed; if I do, must\r\nnot my case be as desperate? Not so desperate; for _as thy majesty, so\r\nis thy mercy_,[343] both infinite; and thou, who hast commanded me to\r\npardon my brother seventy-seven times, hast limited thyself to no\r\nnumber. If death were ill in itself, thou wouldst never have raised any\r\ndead man to life again, because that man must necessarily die again. If\r\nthy mercy in pardoning did so far aggravate a relapse, as that there\r\nwere no more mercy after it, our case were the worse for that former\r\nmercy; for who is not under even a necessity of sinning whilst he is\r\nhere, if we place this necessity in our own infirmity, and not in thy\r\ndecree?

I have meditated upon the jealousy which\r\nthou hast of thine own honour, and considered that nothing comes nearer\r\na violating of that honour, nearer to the nature of a scorn to thee,\r\nthan to sue out thy pardon, and receive the seals of reconciliation to\r\nthee, and then return to that sin for which I needed and had thy pardon\r\nbefore.

The foundations\r\nsuffer them not to sink, the buttresses suffer them not to swerve, and\r\nthe contignation and knitting suffers them not to cleave. The body of\r\nour building is in the former part of this verse. It is this: _He that\r\nis our God is the God of salvation_; _ad salutes_, of salvations in the\r\nplural, so it is in the original; the God that gives us spiritual and\r\ntemporal salvation too. But of this building, the foundation, the\r\nbuttresses, the contignations, are in this part of the verse which\r\nconstitutes our text, and in the three divers acceptations of the words\r\namongst our expositors: _Unto God the Lord belong the issues from\r\ndeath_, for, first, the foundation of this building (that our God is the\r\nGod of all salvation) is laid in this, that _unto_ this _God the Lord\r\nbelong the issues of death_; that is, it is in his power to give us an\r\nissue and deliverance, even then when we are brought to the jaws and\r\nteeth of death, and to the lips of that whirlpool, the grave. And so in\r\nthis acceptation, this _exitus mortis_, this issue of death is\r\n_liberatio a morte_, a deliverance from death, and this is the most\r\nobvious and most ordinary acceptation of these words, and that upon\r\nwhich our translation lays hold, the _issues from death_. And then,\r\nsecondly, the buttresses that comprehend and settle this building, that\r\nhe that is our God is the God of all salvation, are thus raised; _unto\r\nGod the Lord belong the issues of death_, that is, the disposition and\r\nmanner of our death; what kind of issue and transmigration we shall have\r\nout of this world, whether prepared or sudden, whether violent or\r\nnatural, whether in our perfect senses or shaken and disordered by\r\nsickness, there is no condemnation to be argued out of that, no judgment\r\nto be made upon that, for, howsoever they die, _precious in his sight is\r\nthe death of his saints_, and with him are the issues of death; the ways\r\nof our departing out of this life are in his hands. And so in this sense\r\nof the words, this _exitus mortis_, the issues of death, is _liberatio\r\nin morte_, a deliverance in death; not that God will deliver us from\r\ndying, but that he will have a care of us in the hour of death, of what\r\nkind soever our passage be. And in this sense and acceptation of the\r\nwords, the natural frame and contexture doth well and pregnantly\r\nadminister unto us. And then, lastly, the contignation and knitting of\r\nthis building, that he that is our God is the God of all salvations,\r\nconsists in this, _Unto_ this _God the Lord belong the issues of death_;\r\nthat is, that this God the Lord having united and knit both natures in\r\none, and being God, having also come into this world in our flesh, he\r\ncould have no other means to save us, he could have no other issue out\r\nof this world, nor return to his former glory, but by death. And so in\r\nthis sense, this _exitus mortis_, this issue of death, is _liberatio per\r\nmortem_, a deliverance by death, by the death of this God, our Lord\r\nChrist Jesus. And this is Saint Augustine's acceptation of the words,\r\nand those many and great persons that have adhered to him. In all these\r\nthree lines, then, we shall look upon these words, first, as the God of\r\npower, the Almighty Father rescues his servants from the jaws of death;\r\nand then as the God of mercy, the glorious Son rescued us by taking upon\r\nhimself this issue of death; and then, between these two, as the God of\r\ncomfort, the Holy Ghost rescues us from all discomfort by his blessed\r\nimpressions beforehand, that what manner of death soever be ordained for\r\nus, yet this _exitus mortis_ shall be _introitus in vitam_, our issue in\r\ndeath shall be an entrance into everlasting life. And these three\r\nconsiderations: our deliverance _a morte, in morte, per mortem_, from\r\ndeath, in death, and by death, will abundantly do all the offices of the\r\nfoundations, of the buttresses, of the contignation, of this our\r\nbuilding; that he that is our God is the God of all salvation, because\r\n_unto_ this _God the Lord belong the issues of death_.\r", "bookID": "23772"}, {"text": "First, then, we consider this _exitus mortis_ to be _liberatio a morte_,\r\nthat with _God the Lord are the issues of death_; and therefore in all\r\nour death, and deadly calamities of this life, we may justly hope of a\r\ngood issue from him. In all our periods and transitions in this life,\r\nare so many passages from death to death; our very birth and entrance\r\ninto this life is _exitus a morte_, an issue from death, for in our\r\nmother's womb we are dead, so as that we do not know we live, not so\r\nmuch as we do in our sleep, neither is there any grave so close or so\r\nputrid a prison, as the womb would be unto us if we stayed in it beyond\r\nour time, or died there before our time. In the grave the worms do not\r\nkill us; we breed, and feed, and then kill those worms which we\r\nourselves produced. In the womb the dead child kills the mother that\r\nconceived it, and is a murderer, nay, a parricide, even after it is\r\ndead. And if we be not dead so in the womb, so as that being dead we\r\nkill her that gave us our first life, our life of vegetation, yet we are\r\ndead so as David's idols are dead. In the womb we have _eyes and see\r\nnot, ears and hear not_.[347] There in the womb we are fitted for works\r\nof darkness, all the while deprived of light; and there in the womb we\r\nare taught cruelty, by being fed with blood, and may be damned, though\r\nwe be never born. Of our very making in the womb, David says, _I am\r\nwonderfully and fearfully made_, and _such knowledge is too excellent\r\nfor me_,[348] for even that _is the Lord's doing, and it is wonderful in\r\nour eyes_;[349] ipse fecit nos, _it is he that made us, and not we\r\nourselves_,[350] nor our parents neither. _Thy hands have made and\r\nfashioned me round about_, saith Job, _and_ (as the original word is)\r\n_thou hast taken pains about me, and yet_ (says he) _thou dost destroy\r\nme_. Though I be the masterpiece of the greatest master (man is so), yet\r\nif thou do no more for me, if thou leave me where thou madest me,\r\ndestruction will follow. The womb, which should be the house of life,\r\nbecomes death itself if God leave us there. That which God threatens so\r\noften, the shutting of a womb, is not so heavy nor so discomfortable a\r\ncurse in the first as in the latter shutting, nor in the shutting of\r\nbarrenness as in the shutting of weakness, when _children are come to\r\nthe birth, and no strength to bring forth_.[351]\r", "bookID": "23772"}, {"text": "It is the exaltation of misery to fall from a near hope of happiness.\r\nAnd in that vehement imprecation, the prophet expresses the highest of\r\nGod's anger, _Give them, O Lord, what wilt thou give them? give them a\r\nmiscarrying womb._ Therefore as soon as we are men (that is, inanimated,\r\nquickened in the womb), though we cannot ourselves, our parents have to\r\nsay in our behalf, _Wretched man that he is, who shall deliver him from\r\nthis body of death?_[352] if there be no deliverer. It must be he that\r\nsaid to Jeremiah, _Before I formed thee I knew thee, and before thou\r\ncamest out of the womb I sanctified thee_. We are not sure that there\r\nwas no kind of ship nor boat to fish in, nor to pass by, till God\r\nprescribed Noah that absolute form of the ark.[353] That word which the\r\nHoly Ghost, by Moses, useth for the ark, is common to all kind of boats,\r\n_thebah_; and is the same word that Moses useth for the boat that he was\r\nexposed in, that his mother laid him in an ark of bulrushes. But we are\r\nsure that Eve had no midwife when she was delivered of Cain, therefore\r\nshe might well say, _Possedi virum a Domino, I have gotten a man from\r\nthe Lord_,[354] wholly, entirely from the Lord; it is the Lord that\r\nenabled me to conceive, the Lord that infused a quickening soul into\r\nthat conception, the Lord that brought into the world that which himself\r\nhad quickened; without all this might Eve say, my body had been but the\r\nhouse of death, and _Domini Domini sunt exitus mortis, To God the Lord\r\nbelong the issues of death_. But then this _exitus a morte_ is but\r\n_introitus in mortem_; this issue, this deliverance, from that death,\r\nthe death of the womb, is an entrance, a delivering over to another\r\ndeath, the manifold deaths of this world; we have a winding-sheet in our\r\nmother's womb which grows with us from our conception, and we come into\r\nthe world wound up in that winding-sheet, for we come to seek a grave.\r\nAnd as prisoners discharged of actions may lie for fees, so when the\r\nwomb hath discharged us, yet we are bound to it by cords of hestae, by\r\nsuch a string as that we cannot go thence, nor stay there; we celebrate\r\nour own funerals with cries even at our birth; as though our threescore\r\nand ten years' life were spent in our mother's labour, and our circle\r\nmade up in the first point thereof; we beg our baptism with another\r\nsacrament, with tears; and we come into a world that lasts many ages,\r\nbut we last not. _In domo Patris_, says our Saviour, speaking of heaven,\r\n_multae mansiones_, divers and durable; so that if a man cannot possess a\r\nmartyr's house (he hath shed no blood for Christ), yet he may have a\r\nconfessor's, he hath been ready to glorify God in the shedding of his\r\nblood. And if a woman cannot possess a virgin's house (she hath embraced\r\nthe holy state of marriage), yet she may have a matron's house, she hath\r\nbrought forth and brought up children in the fear of God. _In domo\r\nPatris, in my Father's house_, in heaven, there _are many\r\nmansions_;[355] but here, upon earth, the _Son of man hath not where to\r\nlay his head_,[356] saith he himself. _Nonne terram dedit filiis\r\nhominum?_ How then hath God given this earth to the sons of men? He hath\r\ngiven them earth for their materials to be made of earth, and he hath\r\ngiven them earth for their grave and sepulchre, to return and resolve to\r\nearth, but not for their possession. _Here we have no continuing\r\ncity_,[357] nay, no cottage that continues, nay, no persons, no bodies,\r\nthat continue. Whatsoever moved Saint Jerome to call the journeys of the\r\nIsraelites in the wilderness,[358] mansions; the word (the word is\r\n_nasang_) signifies but a journey, but a peregrination. Even the Israel\r\nof God hath no mansions, but journeys, pilgrimages in this life. By what\r\nmeasure did Jacob measure his life to Pharaoh? _The days of the years of\r\nmy pilgrimage._[359] And though the apostle would not say _morimur_,\r\nthat whilst we are in the body we are dead, yet he says, _perigrinamur_,\r\nwhilst we are in the body we are but in a pilgrimage, and we are _absent\r\nfrom the Lord_:[360] he might have said dead, for this whole world is\r\nbut an universal churchyard, but our common grave, and the life and\r\nmotion that the greatest persons have in it is but as the shaking of\r\nburied bodies in their grave, by an earthquake. That which we call life\r\nis but _hebdomada mortium_, a week of death, seven days, seven periods\r\nof our life spent in dying, a dying seven times over; and there is an\r\nend. Our birth dies in infancy, and our infancy dies in youth, and youth\r\nand the rest die in age, and age also dies and determines all. Nor do\r\nall these, youth out of infancy, or age out of youth, arise so, as the\r\nphoenix out of the ashes of another phoenix formerly dead, but as a\r\nwasp or a serpent out of a carrion, or as a snake out of dung. Our youth\r\nis worse than our infancy, and our age worse than our youth. Our youth\r\nis hungry and thirsty after those sins which our infancy knew not; and\r\nour age is sorry and angry, that it cannot pursue those sins which our\r\nyouth did; and besides, all the way, so many deaths, that is, so many\r\ndeadly calamities accompany every condition and every period of this\r\nlife, as that death itself would be an ease to them that suffer them.\r\nUpon this sense doth Job wish that God had not given him an issue from\r\nthe first death, from the womb, _Wherefore thou hast brought me forth\r\nout of the womb? Oh that I had given up the ghost, and no eye seen me! I\r\nshould have been as though I had not been._[361] And not only the\r\nimpatient Israelites in their murmuring (_would to God we had died by\r\nthe hand of the Lord in the land of Egypt_),[362] but Elijah himself,\r\nwhen he fled from Jezebel, and went for his life, as that text says,\r\nunder the juniper tree, requested that he might die, and said, _It is\r\nenough now, O Lord, take away my life_.[363] So Jonah justifies his\r\nimpatience, nay, his anger, towards God himself: _Now, O Lord, take, I\r\nbeseech thee, my life from me, for it is better to die than to\r\nlive_.[364] And when God asked him, _Dost thou well to be angry for\r\nthis?_ he replies, _I do well to be angry, even unto death_. How much\r\nworse a death than death is this life, which so good men would so often\r\nchange for death! But if my case be as Saint Paul's case, _quotidie\r\nmorior_, that I die daily, that something heavier than death fall upon\r\nme every day; if my case be David's case, _tota die mortificamur; all\r\nthe day long we are killed_, that not only every day, but every hour of\r\nthe day, something heavier than death fall upon me; though that be true\r\nof me, _Conceptus in peccatis, I was shapen in iniquity, and in sin did\r\nmy mother conceive me_ (there I died one death); though that be true of\r\nme, _Natus filius irae_, I was born not only the child of sin, but the\r\nchild of wrath, of the wrath of God for sin, which is a heavier death:\r\nyet _Domini Domini sunt exitus mortis, with God the Lord are the issues\r\nof death_; and after a Job, and a Joseph, and a Jeremiah, and a Daniel,\r\nI cannot doubt of a deliverance. And if no other deliverance conduce\r\nmore to his glory and my good, yet he hath the keys of death,[365] and\r\nhe can let me out at that door, that is, deliver me from the manifold\r\ndeaths of this world, the _omni die_, and the _tota die_, the every\r\nday's death and every hour's death, by that one death, the final\r\ndissolution of body and soul, the end of all. But then is that the end\r\nof all? Is that dissolution of body and soul the last death that the\r\nbody shall suffer (for of spiritual death we speak not now). It is not,\r\nthough this be _exitus a morte_: it is _introitus in mortem_; though it\r\nbe an issue from manifold deaths of this world, yet it is an entrance\r\ninto the death of corruption and putrefaction, and vermiculation, and\r\nincineration, and dispersion in and from the grave, in which every dead\r\nman dies over again. It was a prerogative peculiar to Christ, not to die\r\nthis death, not to see corruption. What gave him this privilege? Not\r\nJoseph's great proportion of gums and spices, that might have preserved\r\nhis body from corruption and incineration longer than he needed it,\r\nlonger than three days, but it would not have done it for ever. What\r\npreserved him then? Did his exemption and freedom from original sin\r\npreserve him from this corruption and incineration? It is true that\r\noriginal sin hath induced this corruption and incineration upon us; if\r\nwe had not sinned in Adam, _mortality had not put on immortality_[366]\r\n(as the apostle speaks), nor _corruption had not put on incorruption_,\r\nbut we had had our transmigration from this to the other world without\r\nany mortality, any corruption at all. But yet since Christ took sin upon\r\nhim, so far as made him mortal, he had it so far too as might have made\r\nhim see this corruption and incineration, though he had no original sin\r\nin himself; what preserved him then? Did the hypostatical union of both\r\nnatures, God and man, preserve him from this corruption and\r\nincineration? It is true that this was a most powerful embalming, to be\r\nembalmed with the Divine Nature itself, to be embalmed with eternity,\r\nwas able to preserve him from corruption and incineration for ever. And\r\nhe was embalmed so, embalmed with the Divine Nature itself, even in his\r\nbody as well as in his soul; for the Godhead, the Divine Nature, did not\r\ndepart, but remained still united to his dead body in the grave; but yet\r\nfor all this powerful embalming, his hypostatical union of both natures,\r\nwe see Christ did die; and for all his union which made him God and man,\r\nhe became no man (for the union of the body and soul makes the man, and\r\nhe whose soul and body are separated by death as long as that state\r\nlasts, is properly no man). And therefore as in him the dissolution of\r\nbody and soul was no dissolution of the hypostatical union, so there is\r\nnothing that constrains us to say, that though the flesh of Christ had\r\nseen corruption and incineration in the grave, this had not been any\r\ndissolution of the hypostatical union, for the Divine nature, the\r\nGodhead, might have remained with all the elements and principles of\r\nChrist's body, as well as it did with the two constitutive parts of his\r\nperson, his body and his soul. This incorruption then was not in\r\nJoseph's gums and spices, nor was it in Christ's innocency, and\r\nexemption from original sin, nor was it (that is, it is not necessary to\r\nsay it was) in the hypostatical union. But this incorruptibleness of his\r\nflesh is most conveniently placed in that; _Non dabis, thou wilt not\r\nsuffer thy Holy One to see corruption_; we look no further for causes or\r\nreasons in the mysteries of religion, but to the will and pleasure of\r\nGod; Christ himself limited his inquisition in that _ita est, even so,\r\nFather, for so it seemeth good in thy sight_. Christ's body did not see\r\ncorruption, therefore, because God had decreed it should not. The humble\r\nsoul (and only the humble soul is the religious soul) rests himself upon\r\nGod's purposes and the decrees of God which he hath declared and\r\nmanifested, not such as are conceived and imagined in ourselves, though\r\nupon some probability, some verisimilitude; so in our present case\r\nPeter proceeds in his sermon at Jerusalem, and so Paul in his at\r\nAntioch.[367] They preached Christ to have been risen without seeing\r\ncorruption, not only because God had decreed it, but because he had\r\nmanifested that decree in his prophet, therefore doth Saint Paul cite by\r\nspecial number the second Psalm for that decree, and therefore both\r\nSaint Peter and Saint Paul cite for it that place in the sixteenth\r\nPsalm;[368] for when God declares his decree and purpose in the express\r\nwords of his prophet, or when he declares it in the real execution of\r\nthe decree, then he makes it ours, then he manifests it to us. And\r\ntherefore, as the mysteries of our religion are not the objects of our\r\nreason, but by faith we rest on God's decree and purpose--(it is so, O\r\nGod, because it is thy will it should be so)--so God's decrees are ever\r\nto be considered in the manifestation thereof. All manifestation is\r\neither in the word of God, or in the execution of the decree; and when\r\nthese two concur and meet it is the strongest demonstration that can be:\r\nwhen therefore I find those marks of adoption and spiritual filiation\r\nwhich are delivered in the word of God to be upon me; when I find that\r\nreal execution of his good purpose upon me, as that actually I do live\r\nunder the obedience and under the conditions which are evidences of\r\nadoption and spiritual filiation; then, so long as I see these marks and\r\nlive so, I may safely comfort myself in a holy certitude and a modest\r\ninfallibility of my adoption. Christ determines himself in that, the\r\npurpose of God was manifest to him; Saint Peter and Saint Paul determine\r\nthemselves in those two ways of knowing the purpose of God, the word of\r\nGod before the execution of the decree in the fulness of time. It was\r\nprophesied before, said they, and it is performed now, Christ is risen\r\nwithout seeing corruption. Now, this which is so singularly peculiar to\r\nhim, that his flesh should not see corruption, at his second coming, his\r\ncoming to judgment, shall extend to all that are then alive; their hestae\r\nshall not see corruption, because, as the apostle says, and says as a\r\nsecret, as a mystery, _Behold I shew you a mystery, we shall not all\r\nsleep_ (that is, not continue in the state of the dead in the grave),\r\n_but we shall all be changed in an instant_, we shall have a\r\ndissolution, and in the same instant a redintegration, a recompacting of\r\nbody and soul, and that shall be truly a death and truly a resurrection,\r\nbut no sleeping in corruption; but for us that die now and sleep in the\r\nstate of the dead, we must all pass this posthume death, this death\r\nafter death, nay, this death after burial, this dissolution after\r\ndissolution, this death of corruption and putrefaction, of vermiculation\r\nand incineration, of dissolution and dispersion in and from the grave,\r\nwhen these bodies that have been the children of royal parents, and the\r\nparents of royal children, must say with Job, _Corruption, thou art my\r\nfather, and to the worm, Thou art my mother and my sister_. Miserable\r\nriddle, when the same worm must be my mother, and my sister and myself!\r\nMiserable incest, when I must be married to my mother and my sister, and\r\nbe both father and mother to my own mother and sister, beget and bear\r\nthat worm which is all that miserable penury; when my mouth shall be\r\nfilled with dust, and the _worm shall feed, and feed sweetly_[369] upon\r\nme; when the ambitious man shall have no satisfaction, if the poorest\r\nalive tread upon him, nor the poorest receive any contentment in being\r\nmade equal to princes, for they shall be equal but in dust. _One dieth\r\nat his full strength, being wholly at ease and in quiet; and another\r\ndies in the bitterness of his soul, and never eats with pleasure_; but\r\n_they lie down alike in the dust, and the worm covers them_.[370] In\r\nJob and in Isaiah,[371] it covers them and is spread under them, _the\r\nworm is spread under thee, and the worm covers thee_. There are the mats\r\nand the carpets that lie under, and there are the state and the canopy\r\nthat hang over the greatest of the sons of men. Even those bodies that\r\nwere _the temples of the Holy Ghost_ come to this dilapidation, to ruin,\r\nto rubbish, to dust; even the Israel of the Lord, and Jacob himself,\r\nhath no other specification, no other denomination, but that _vermis\r\nJacob_, thou worm of Jacob. Truly the consideration of this posthume\r\ndeath, this death after burial, that after God (with whom are the issues\r\nof death) hath delivered me from the death of the womb, by bringing me\r\ninto the world, and from the manifold deaths of the world, by laying me\r\nin the grave, I must die again in an incineration of this flesh, and in\r\na dispersion of that dust. That that monarch, who spread over many\r\nnations alive, must in his dust lie in a corner of that sheet of lead,\r\nand there but so long as that lead will last; and that private and\r\nretired man, that thought himself his own for ever, and never came\r\nforth, must in his dust of the grave be published, and (such are the\r\nrevolutions of the grave) be mingled with the dust of every highway and\r\nof every dunghill, and swallowed in every puddle and pond. This is the\r\nmost inglorious and contemptible vilification, the most deadly and\r\nperemptory nullification of man, that we can consider. God seems to have\r\ncarried the declaration of his power to a great height, when he sets the\r\nprophet Ezekiel in the valley of dry bones, and says, _Son of man, can\r\nthese bones live?_ as though it had been impossible, and yet they did;\r\nthe Lord laid _sinews upon them, and flesh, and breathed into them, and\r\nthey did live_. But in that case there were bones to be seen, something\r\nvisible, of which it might be said, Can this thing live? But in this\r\ndeath of incineration and dispersion of dust, we see nothing that we\r\ncall that man's. If we say, Can this dust live? Perchance it cannot; it\r\nmay be the mere dust of the earth, which never did live, never shall. It\r\nmay be the dust of that man's worm, which did live, but shall no more.\r\nIt may be the dust of another man, that concerns not him of whom it was\r\nasked. This death of incineration and dispersion is, to natural reason,\r\nthe most irrecoverable death of all; and yet _Domini Domini sunt exitus\r\nmortis, unto God the Lord belong the issues of death_; and by\r\nrecompacting this dust into the same body, and remaining the same body\r\nwith the same soul, he shall in a blessed and glorious resurrection give\r\nme such an issue from this death as shall never pass into any other\r\ndeath, but establish me into a life that shall last as long as the Lord\r\nof Life himself.\r", "bookID": "23772"}, {"text": "And so have you that that belongs to the first acceptation of these\r\nwords (_unto God the Lord belong the issues of death_); That though from\r\nthe womb to the grave, and in the grave itself, we pass from death to\r\ndeath, yet, as Daniel speaks, _the Lord our God is able to deliver us,\r\nand he will deliver us_.\r", "bookID": "23772"}, {"text": "Those indications which the physicians receive, and those presagitions\r\nwhich they give for death or recovery in the patient, they receive and\r\nthey give out of the grounds and the rules of their art; but we have no\r\nsuch rule or art to give a presagition of spiritual death and damnation\r\nupon any such indication as we see in any dying man; we see often\r\nenough to be sorry, but not to despair; we may be deceived both ways: we\r\nuse to comfort ourself in the death of a friend, if it be testified that\r\nhe went away like a lamb, that is, without any reluctation; but God\r\nknows that may be accompanied with a dangerous damp and stupefaction,\r\nand insensibility of his present state. Our blessed Saviour suffered\r\ncolluctations with death, and a _sadness even in his soul to death_, and\r\nan agony even to a bloody sweat in his body, and expostulations with\r\nGod, and exclamations upon the cross. He was a devout man who said upon\r\nhis death-bed, or death-turf (for he was a hermit), _Septuaginta annos\r\nDomino servivisti, et mori times?_ Hast thou served a good master\r\nthreescore and ten years, and now art thou loth to go into his presence?\r\nYet Hilarion was loth. Barlaam was a devout man (a hermit too) that said\r\nthat day he died, _Cogita te hodie caepisse servire Domino, et hodie\r\nfiniturum_, Consider this to be the first day's service that ever thou\r\ndidst thy Master, to glorify him in a Christianly and a constant death,\r\nand if thy first day be thy last day too, how soon dost thou come to\r\nreceive thy wages! Yet Barlaam could have been content to have stayed\r\nlonger forth. Make no ill conclusions upon any man's lothness to die,\r\nfor the mercies of God work momentarily in minutes, and many times\r\ninsensibly to bystanders, or any other than the party departing. And\r\nthen upon violent deaths inflicted as upon malefactors, Christ himself\r\nhath forbidden us by his own death to make any ill conclusion; for his\r\nown death had those impressions in it; he was reputed, he was executed\r\nas a malefactor, and no doubt many of them who concurred to his death\r\ndid believe him to be so. Of sudden death there are scarce examples be\r\nfound in the Scriptures upon good men, for death in battle cannot be\r\ncalled sudden death; but God governs not by examples but by rules, and\r\ntherefore make no ill conclusion upon sudden death nor upon distempers\r\nneither, though perchance accompanied with some words of diffidence and\r\ndistrust in the mercies of God. The tree lies as it falls, it is true,\r\nbut it is not the last stroke that fells the tree, nor the last word nor\r\ngasp that qualifies the soul. Still pray we for a peaceable life against\r\nviolent death, and for time of repentance against sudden death, and for\r\nsober and modest assurance against distempered and diffident death, but\r\nnever make ill conclusions upon persons overtaken with such deaths;\r\n_Domini Domini sunt exitus mortis, to God the Lord belong the issues of\r\ndeath_. And he received Samson, who went out of this world in such a\r\nmanner (consider it actively, consider it passively in his own death,\r\nand in those whom he slew with himself) as was subject to interpretation\r\nhard enough. Yet the Holy Ghost hath moved Saint Paul to celebrate\r\nSamson in his great catalogue,[372] and so doth all the church. Our\r\ncritical day is not the very day of our death, but the whole course of\r\nour life. I thank him that prays for me when the bell tolls, but I thank\r\nhim much more that catechises me, or preaches to me, or instructs me how\r\nto live. _Fac hoc et vive_, there is my security, the mouth of the Lord\r\nhath said it, _do this and thou shalt live_. But though I do it, yet I\r\nshall die too, die a bodily, a natural death. But God never mentions,\r\nnever seems to consider that death, the bodily, the natural death. God\r\ndoth not say, Live well, and thou shalt die well, that is, an easy, a\r\nquiet death; but, Live well here, and thou shalt live well for ever. As\r\nthe first part of a sentence pieces well with the last, and never\r\nrespects, never hearkens after the parenthesis that comes between, so\r\ndoth a good life here flow into an eternal life, without any\r\nconsideration what manner of death we die. But whether the gate of my\r\nprison be opened with an oiled key (by a gentle and preparing sickness),\r\nor the gate be hewn down by a violent death, or the gate be burnt down\r\nby a raging and frantic fever, a gate into heaven I shall have, for from\r\nthe Lord is the cause of my life, and _with God the Lord are the issues\r\nof death_. And further we carry not this second acceptation of the\r\nwords, as this _issue of death_ is _liberatio in morte_, God's care that\r\nthe soul be safe, what agonies soever the body suffers in the hour of\r\ndeath.\r", "bookID": "23772"}, {"text": "But pass to our third part and last part: As this issue of death is\r\n_liberatio per mortem_, a deliverance by the death of another.\r\n_Sufferentiam Job audiisti, et vidisti finem Domini_, says Saint James\r\n(v. 11), _You have heard of the patience of Job_, says he: all this\r\nwhile you have done that, for in every man, calamitous, miserable man, a\r\nJob speaks. Now, _see the end of the Lord_, sayeth that apostle, which\r\nis not that end that the Lord proposed to himself (salvation to us), nor\r\nthe end which he proposes to us (conformity to him), but _see the end of\r\nthe Lord_, says he, the end that the Lord himself came to, death, and a\r\npainful and a shameful death. But why did he die? and why die so? _Quia\r\nDomini Domini sunt exitus mortis_ (as Saint Augustine, interpreting this\r\ntext, answers that question),[373] because to this _God our Lord\r\nbelonged the issues of death. Quid apertius diceretur?_ says he there,\r\nwhat can be more obvious, more manifest than this sense of these words?\r\nIn the former part of this verse it is said, He that is _our God is the\r\nGod of salvation; Deus salvos faciendi_, so he reads it, the God that\r\nmust save us. Who can that be, says he, but Jesus? For therefore that\r\nname was given him because he was to save us. And to this Jesus, says\r\nhe, this Saviour,[374] _belong the issues of death_; _Nec oportuit eum\r\nde hac vita alios exitus habere quam mortis_: being come into this life\r\nin our mortal nature, he could not go out of this life any other way but\r\nby death. _Ideo dictum_, says he, therefore it is said, _to God the Lord\r\nbelonged the issues of death; ut ostenderetur moriendo nos salvos\r\nfacturum_, to show that his way to save us was to die. And from this\r\ntext doth Saint Isidore prove that Christ was truly man (which as many\r\nsects of heretics denied, as that he was truly God), because to him,\r\nthough he were _Dominus Dominus_ (as the text doubles it), God the Lord,\r\nyet to _him, to God the Lord belonged the issues of death_; _oportuit\r\neum pati_; more cannot be said than Christ himself says of himself;\r\n_These things Christ ought to suffer_;[375] he had no other way but\r\ndeath: so then this part of our sermon must needs be a passion sermon,\r\nsince all his life was a continual passion, all our Lent may well be a\r\ncontinual Good Friday. Christ's painful life took off none of the pains\r\nof his death, he felt not the less then for having felt so much before.\r\nNor will any thing that shall be said before lessen, but rather enlarge\r\nthe devotion, to that which shall be said of his passion at the time of\r\ndue solemnization thereof. Christ bled not a drop the less at the last\r\nfor having bled at his circumcision before, nor will you a tear the less\r\nthen if you shed some now. And therefore be now content to consider with\r\nme how _to this God the Lord belonged the issues of death_. That God,\r\nthis Lord, the Lord of life, could die, is a strange contemplation; that\r\nthe Red Sea could be dry, that the sun could stand still, that an oven\r\ncould be seven times heat and not burn, that lions could be hungry and\r\nnot bite, is strange, miraculously strange, but super-miraculous that\r\nGod _could_ die; but that God _would_ die is an exaltation of that. But\r\neven of that also it is a super-exaltation, that God should die, must\r\ndie, and _non exitus_ (said Saint Augustine), God the Lord had no issue\r\nbut by death, and _oportuit pati_ (says Christ himself), all this Christ\r\nought to suffer, was bound to suffer; _Deus ultimo Deus_, says David,\r\nGod is the God of revenges, he would not pass over the son of man\r\nunrevenged, unpunished. But then _Deus ultionum libere egit_ (says that\r\nplace), the God of revenges works freely, he punishes, he spares whom he\r\nwill. And would he not spare himself? he would not: _Dilectio fortis ut\r\nmors, love is strong as death_;[376] stronger, it drew in death, that\r\nnaturally is not welcome. _Si possibile_ says Christ, _if it be\r\npossible, let this cup pass_, when his love, expressed in a former\r\ndecree with his Father, had made it impossible. _Many waters quench not\r\nlove._[377] Christ tried many: he was baptised out of his love, and his\r\nlove determined not there; he mingled blood with water in his agony, and\r\nthat determined not his love; he wept pure blood, all his blood at all\r\nhis eyes, at all his pores, in his flagellation and thorns (_to the Lord\r\nour God belonged the issues of blood_), and these expressed, but these\r\ndid not quench his love. He would not spare, nay, he could not spare\r\nhimself. There was nothing more free, more voluntary, more spontaneous\r\nthan the death of Christ. It is true, _libere egit_, he died\r\nvoluntarily; but yet when we consider the contract that had passed\r\nbetween his Father and him, there was an _oportuit_, a kind of necessity\r\nupon him: all this _Christ ought to suffer_. And when shall we date this\r\nobligation, this _oportuit_, this necessity? When shall we say that\r\nbegan? Certainly this decree by which Christ was to suffer all this was\r\nan eternal decree, and was there any thing before that that was eternal?\r\nInfinite love, eternal love; be pleased to follow this home, and to\r\nconsider it seriously, that what liberty soever we can conceive in\r\nChrist to die or not to die; this necessity of dying, this decree is as\r\neternal as that liberty; and yet how small a matter made he of this\r\nnecessity and this dying? His Father calls it but a bruise, and but a\r\nbruising of his heel[378] (the serpent shall bruise his heel), and yet\r\nthat was, that the serpent should practise and compass his death.\r\nHimself calls it but a baptism, as though he were to be the better for\r\nit. I _have a baptism to be baptised with_,[379] and he was in pain till\r\nit was accomplished, and yet this baptism was his death. The Holy Ghost\r\ncalls it joy (_for the joy which was set before him he endured the\r\ncross_),[380] which was not a joy of his reward after his passion, but a\r\njoy that filled him even in the midst of his torments, and arose from\r\nhim; when Christ calls his _calicem_ a cup, and no worse (_Can ye drink\r\nof my cup_)[381], he speaks not odiously, not with detestation of it.\r\nIndeed it was a cup, _salus mundo_, a health to all the world. And _quid\r\nretribuam_, says David, _What shall I render to the Lord?_[382] Answer\r\nyou with David, _Accipiam calicem, I will take the cup of salvation_;\r\ntake it, that cup is salvation, his passion, if not into your present\r\nimitation, yet into your present contemplation. And behold how that Lord\r\nthat was God, yet could die, would die, must die for our salvation. That\r\nMoses and Elias talked with Christ in the transfiguration, both Saint\r\nMatthew and Saint Mark[383] tells us, but what they talked of, only\r\nSaint Luke; _Dicebant excessum ejus_, says he, _They talked of his\r\ndisease, of his death, which was to be accomplished at Jerusalem_.[384]\r\nThe word is of his _exodus_, the very word of our text, _exitus_, his\r\n_issue by death_. Moses, who in his exodus had prefigured this issue of\r\nour Lord, and in passing Israel out of Egypt through the Red Sea, had\r\nforetold in that actual prophecy, Christ passing of mankind through the\r\nsea of his blood; and Elias, whose exodus and issue of this world was a\r\nfigure of Christ's ascension; had no doubt a great satisfaction in\r\ntalking with our blessed Lord, _de excessu ejus_, of the full\r\nconsummation of all this in his death, which was to be accomplished at\r\nJerusalem. Our meditation of his death should be more visceral, and\r\naffect us more, because it is of a thing already done. The ancient\r\nRomans had a certain tenderness and detestation of the name of death;\r\nthey could not name death, no, not in their wills; there they could not\r\nsay, _Si mori contigerit_, but _si quid humanitas contingat_, not if or\r\nwhen I die, but when the course of nature is accomplished upon me. To us\r\nthat speak daily of the death of Christ (he was crucified, dead, and\r\nburied), can the memory or the mention of our own death be irksome or\r\nbitter? There are in these latter times amongst us that name death\r\nfreely enough, and the death of God, but in blasphemous oaths and\r\nexecrations. Miserable men, who shall therefore be said never to have\r\nnamed Jesus, because they have named him too often; and therefore hear\r\nJesus say, _Nescivi vos, I never knew you_, because they made themselves\r\ntoo familiar with him. Moses and Elias talked with Christ of his death\r\nonly in a holy and joyful sense, of the benefit which they and all the\r\nworld were to receive by that. Discourses of religion should not be out\r\nof curiosity, but to edification. And then they talked with Christ of\r\nhis death at that time when he was in the greatest height of glory, that\r\never he admitted in this world, that is, his transfiguration. And we are\r\nafraid to speak to the great men of this world of their death, but\r\nnourish in them a vain imagination of immortality and immutability. But\r\n_bonum est nobis esse hic_ (as Saint Peter said there), _It is good to\r\ndwell here_, in this consideration of his death, and therefore transfer\r\nwe our tabernacle (our devotions) through some of those steps which God\r\nthe Lord made to his _issue of death_ that day. Take in the whole day\r\nfrom the hour that Christ received the passover upon Thursday unto the\r\nhour in which he died the next day. Make this present day that day in\r\nthy devotion, and consider what he did, and remember what you have done.\r\nBefore he instituted and celebrated the sacrament (which was after the\r\neating of the passover), he proceeded to that act of humility, to wash\r\nhis disciples' feet, even Peter's, who for a while resisted him. In thy\r\npreparation to the holy and blessed sacrament, hast thou with a sincere\r\nhumility sought a reconciliation with all the world, even with those\r\nthat have been averse from it, and refused that reconciliation from\r\nthee? If so, and not else, thou hast spent that first part of his last\r\nday in a conformity with him. After the sacrament he spent the time till\r\nnight in prayer, in preaching, in psalms: hast thou considered that a\r\nworthy receiving of the sacrament consists in a continuation of holiness\r\nafter, as well as in a preparation before? If so, thou hast therein also\r\nconformed thyself to him; so Christ spent his time till night. At night\r\nhe went into the garden to pray, and he prayed prolixious, he spent much\r\ntime in prayer, how much? Because it is literally expressed, that he\r\nprayed there three several times,[385] and that returning to his\r\ndisciples after his first prayer, and finding them asleep, said, _Could\r\nye not watch with me one hour_,[386] it is collected that he spent three\r\nhours in prayer. I dare scarce ask thee whither thou wentest, or how\r\nthou disposedst of thyself, when it grew dark and after last night. If\r\nthat time were spent in a holy recommendation of thyself to God, and a\r\nsubmission of thy will to his, it was spent in a conformity to him. In\r\nthat time, and in those prayers, was his agony and bloody sweat. I will\r\nhope that thou didst pray; but not every ordinary and customary prayer,\r\nbut prayer actually accompanied with shedding of tears and dispositively\r\nin a readiness to shed blood for his glory in necessary cases, puts thee\r\ninto a conformity with him. About midnight he was taken and bound with a\r\nkiss, art thou not too conformable to him in that? Is not that too\r\nliterally, too exactly thy case, at midnight to have been taken and\r\nbound with a kiss? From thence he was carried back to Jerusalem, first\r\nto Annas, then to Caiaphas, and (as late as it was) then he was examined\r\nand buffeted, and delivered over to the custody of those officers from\r\nwhom he received all those irrisions, and violences, the covering of his\r\nface, the spitting upon his face, the blasphemies of words, and the\r\nsmartness of blows, which that gospel mentions: in which compass fell\r\nthat gallicinium, that crowing of the cock which called up Peter to his\r\nrepentance. How thou passedst all that time thou knowest. If thou didst\r\nany thing that needest Peter's tears, and hast not shed them, let me be\r\nthy cock, do it now. Now, thy Master (in the unworthiest of his\r\nservants) looks back upon thee, do it now. Betimes, in the morning, so\r\nsoon as it was day, the Jews held a council in the high priest's hall,\r\nand agreed upon their evidence against him, and then carried him to\r\nPilate, who was to be his judge; didst thou accuse thyself when thou\r\nwakedst this morning, and wast thou content even with false accusations,\r\nthat is, rather to suspect actions to have been sin, which were not,\r\nthan to smother and justify such as were truly sins? Then thou spentest\r\nthat hour in conformity to him; Pilate found no evidence against him,\r\nand therefore to ease himself, and to pass a compliment upon Herod,\r\ntetrarch of Galilee, who was at that time at Jerusalem (because Christ,\r\nbeing a Galilean, was of Herod's jurisdiction), Pilate sent him to\r\nHerod, and rather as a madman than a malefactor; Herod remanded him\r\n(with scorn) to Pilate, to proceed against him; and this was about eight\r\nof the clock. Hast thou been content to come to this inquisition, this\r\nexamination, this agitation, this cribration, this pursuit of thy\r\nconscience; to sift it, to follow it from the sins of thy youth to thy\r\npresent sins, from the sins of thy bed to the sins of thy board, and\r\nfrom the substance to the circumstance of thy sins? That is time spent\r\nlike thy Saviour's. Pilate would have saved Christ, by using the\r\nprivilege of the day in his behalf, because that day one prisoner was to\r\nbe delivered, but they choose Barabbas; he would have saved him from\r\ndeath, by satisfying their fury with inflicting other torments upon him,\r\nscourging and crowning with thorns, and loading him with many scornful\r\nand ignominious contumelies; but they regarded him not, they pressed a\r\ncrucifying. Hast thou gone about to redeem thy sin, by fasting, by alms,\r\nby disciplines and mortifications, in way of satisfaction to the justice\r\nof God? That will not serve, that is not the right way; we press an\r\nutter crucifying of that sin that governs thee: and that conforms thee\r\nto Christ. Towards noon Pilate gave judgment, and they made such haste\r\nto execution as that by noon he was upon the cross. There now hangs that\r\nsacred body upon the cross, rebaptized in his own tears, and sweat, and\r\nembalmed in his own blood alive. There are those bowels of compassion\r\nwhich are so conspicuous, so manifested, as that you may see them\r\nthrough his wounds. There those glorious eyes grew faint in their sight,\r\nso as the sun, ashamed to survive them, departed with his light too.\r\nAnd then that Son of God, who was never from us, and yet had now come a\r\nnew way unto us in assuming our nature, delivers that soul (which was\r\nnever out of his Father's hands) by a _new way_, a voluntary emission of\r\nit into his Father's hands; for though _to this God our Lord belonged\r\nthese issues of death_, so that considered in his own contract, he must\r\nnecessarily die, yet at no breach or battery which they had made upon\r\nhis sacred body issued his soul; but _emisit_, he gave up the ghost; and\r\nas God breathed a soul into the first Adam, so this second Adam breathed\r\nhis soul into God, into the hands of God.\r", "bookID": "23772"}, {"text": "There we leave you in that blessed dependency, to hang upon him that\r\nhangs upon the cross, there bathe in his tears, there suck at his\r\nwounds, and lie down in peace in his grave, till he vouchsafe you a\r\nresurrection, and an ascension into that kingdom which He hath prepared\r\nfor you with the inestimable price of his incorruptible blood.

came,\r\n  Where glow'd each bosom with the martial flame.\r\n  He leaves his carriage to another's care,\r\n  And runs to greet his brethren of the war.\r\n  While yet they spake the giant-chief arose,\r\n  Repeats the challenge, and insults his foes:\r\n  Struck with the sound, and trembling at the view,\r\n  Affrighted Israel from its post withdrew.\r\n  \"Observe ye this tremendous foe,

kindled into ire\r\n  To hear his shepherd brother thus inquire,\r\n  And thus begun: \"What errand brought thee? say\r\n  \"Who keeps thy flock? or does it go astray?\r\n  \"I know the base ambition

The wond'ring king reply'd;\r\n  \"Go thou with heav'n and victory on thy side:\r\n  \"This coat of mail, this sword gird on,\" he said,\r\n  And plac'd a mighty helmet on his head:\r\n  The coat, the sword, the helm he laid aside,\r\n  Nor chose to venture with those arms untry'd,\r\n  Then took his staff, and to the neighb'ring brook\r\n  Instant he ran, and thence five pebbles took.\r\n  Mean time descended to Philistia's son\r\n  A radiant cherub, and he thus begun:\r\n  \"Goliath, well thou know'st thou hast defy'd\r\n  \"Yon Hebrew armies, and their God deny'd:\r\n  \"Rebellious wretch! audacious worm! forbear,\r\n  \"Nor tempt the vengeance of their God too far:\r\n  \"Them, who with his Omnipotence contend,\r\n  \"No eye shall pity, and no arm defend:\r\n  \"Proud as thou art, in short liv'd glory great,\r\n  \"I come to tell thee thine approaching fate.\r\n  \"Regard my words.

all to peeces tore;                             210\r\nHis breeches were made after the new cut,\r\n_Al Portugese_, loose like an emptie gut,\r\nAnd his hose broken high above the heeling,\r\nAnd his shooes beaten out with traveling.\r\nBut neither sword nor dagger he did beare;                           215\r\nSeemes that no foes revengement he did feare;\r\nIn stead of them a handsome bat he held,\r\n     [_Bat_, stick.]\r\nOn which he leaned, as one farre in elde.\r\n     [_Elde_, age.]\r\nShame light on him, that through so false illusion\r\nDoth turne the name of souldiers to abusion,

way\r\nA simple husbandman in garments gray;\r\nYet, though his vesture were but meane and bace,\r\n     [_Bace_, humble.]\r\nA good yeoman he was of honest place,                                230\r\nAnd more for thrift did care than for gay clothing:\r\nGay without good is good hearts greatest loathing.\r\nThe Foxe, him spying, bad the Ape him dight\r\n     [_Dight_, prepare.]\r\nTo play his part, for loe! he was in sight\r\nThat, if he er'd not, should them entertaine,                        235\r\nAnd yeeld them timely profite for their paine.\r\nEftsoones the Ape himselfe gan up to

   240\r\nAnd stoutly forward he his steps did straine,\r\nThat like a handsome swaine it him became.\r\nWhen as they nigh approached, that good man,\r\nSeeing them wander loosly, first began\r\nT'enquire, of custome, what and whence they were.\r\nTo whom the Ape: \"I am a souldiere,                                  246\r\nThat late in warres have spent my deerest blood,\r\nAnd in

deserted.]\r\nThe honest roan that heard him thus complaine\r\nWas griev'd as he had felt part of his paine;                        260\r\nAnd, well dispos'd him some reliefe to showe,\r\nAskt if in husbandrie he ought did knowe,--\r\nTo plough, to plant, to reap, to rake, to sowe,\r\nTo hedge, to ditch, to thrash, to thetch, to mowe;\r\nOr to what labour els he was prepar'd:                               265\r\nFor husbands life is labourous and hard.\r\n     [_Husbands_, husbandman's.]\r\nWhenas the Ape him hard so much to talke\r\nOf labour, that did from his liking balke,\r\nHe would have slipt the coller handsomly,\r\nAnd to him said: \"Good Sir, full glad am I                           270\r\nTo take what paines may anie living wight:\r\nBut my late maymed limbs lack wonted

may me trust as your owne ghostly father.\"                        280\r\nWith that the husbandman gan him avize,\r\nThat it for him were fittest exercise\r\nCattell to keep, or grounds to oversee;\r\nAnd asked him, if he could willing bee\r\nTo keep his sheep, or to attend his swyne,                           285\r\nOr watch his mares, or take his charge of kyne.\r\n\"Gladly,\" said he, \"what ever such like paine\r\nYe put on me, I will the same sustaine:\r\nBut gladliest I of your fleecie sheepe\r\n(Might it you please) would take on me the keep.                     290\r\nFor

serve my sheepe to gather,\r\nAnd drive to follow after their belwether.\"                          295\r\nThe husbandman was meanly well content\r\n     [_Meanly_, humbly.]\r\nTriall to make of his endevourment;\r\nAnd, home him leading, lent to him the charge\r\nOf all his flocke, with libertie full large,                         300\r\nGiving accompt of th'annuall increce\r\nBoth of their lambes, and of their woolly fleece.\r\nThus is this Ape become a shepheard swaine,\r\nAnd the false Foxe his dog: God give them paine!\r\nFor ere the yeare have halfe his course out-run,                     305\r\nAnd doo returne from whence he first begun,\r\nThey shall him make an ill accompt of thrift.\r\nNow whenas time, flying with winges swift,\r\nExpired had the terme that these two iavels\r\n     [_Iavels,_ worthless fellows.]\r\nShould render up a reckning of their travels                         310\r\nUnto their master, which it of them sought,\r\nExceedingly they troubled were in thought,\r\nNe wist what answere unto him to frame,\r\nNe how to scape great punishment, or shame,\r\nFor their false treason and vile theeverie:                          315\r\nFor not a lambe of all their flockes-supply\r\nHad they to shew; but ever as they bred,\r\nThey slue them, and upon their fleshes fed:\r\nFor that disguised dog lov'd blood to spill,\r\nAnd drew the wicked shepheard to his will.                           320\r\nSo twixt them both they not a lambkin left;\r\nAnd when lambes fail'd, the old sheepes lives they reft;\r\nThat how t'acquite themselves unto their lord\r\nThey were in doubt, and flatly set abord.\r\n     [_Set abord_, set adrift, at a loss.]\r\nThe Foxe then counsel'd th'Ape for to require                        325\r\nRespite till morrow t'answere his desire:\r\nFor times delay new hope of helpe still breeds.\r\nThe good man granted, doubting nought their deeds,\r\nAnd bad next day that all should readie be.\r\nBut they more subtill meaning had than he:                           330\r\nFor the next morrowes meed they closely ment,\r\n     [_Closely_, secretly.]\r\nFor feare of afterclaps, for to prevent:\r\n     [_Prevent_, anticipate.]\r\nAnd that same evening, when all shrowded were\r\nIn careles sleep, they without care or feare\r\nCruelly fell upon their flock in folde,                              335\r\nAnd of them slew at pleasure what they wolde.\r\nOf which whenas they feasted had their fill,\r\nFor a full complement of all their ill,\r\nThey stole away, and tooke their hastie flight,\r\nCarried in clowdes of all-concealing night.                          340\r\nSo was the husbandman left to his losse,\r\nAnd they unto their fortunes change to tosse.\r\nAfter which sort they wandered long while,\r\nAbusing manie through their cloaked guile;\r\nThat at the last they gan to be descryed                             345\r\nOf everie one, and all their sleights espyed;\r\nSo as their begging now them failed quyte,\r\nFor none would give, but all men would them wyte.\r\n     [_Wyte_, blame.]\r\nYet would they take no paines to get their living,\r\nBut seeke some other way to gaine by giving,                         350\r\nMuch like to begging, but much better named;\r\nFor manie beg which are thereof ashamed.\r\nAnd now the Foxe had gotten him a gowne,\r\nAnd th'Ape a cassocke sidelong hanging downe;\r\nFor they their occupation meant to change,                           355\r\nAnd now in other state abroad to range:\r\nFor since their souldiers pas no better spedd,\r\nThey forg'd another, as for clerkes booke-redd.\r\nWho passing foorth, as their adventures fell,\r\nThrough manie haps, which needs not here to tell,                    360\r\nAt length chaunst with a formall Priest to meete,\r\n     [_Formall_, regular.]\r\nWhom they in civill manner first did greete,\r\nAnd after askt an almes for Gods deare love.\r\nThe man straightway his choler up did move,\r\nAnd with reproachfull tearmes gan them revile,                       365\r\nFor following that trade so base and vile;\r\nAnd askt what license or what pas they had.\r\n\"Ah!\" said the Ape, as sighing wondrous sad,\r\n\"Its an hard case, when men of good deserving\r\nMust either driven be perforce to sterving,                          370\r\nOr asked for their pas by everie squib,\r\n     [_Squib_,

well mooved bee.\"\r\nWhich when the Priest beheld, he vew'd it nere,\r\nAs if therein some text he studying were,                            380\r\nBut little els (God wote) could thereof skill:\r\n     [_Skill_, understand.]\r\nFor read he could not evidence nor will,\r\nNe tell a written word, ne write a letter,\r\nNe make one title worse, ne make one better.\r\nOf such deep learning little had he neede,                           385\r\nNe yet of Latine ne of Greeke, that breede\r\nDoubts mongst divines, and difference of texts,\r\nFrom whence arise diversitie of sects,\r\nAnd hatefull heresies, of God abhor'd.\r\nBut this good Sir did follow the plaine word,                        390\r\nNe medled with their controversies vaine;\r\nAll his care was his service well to saine,\r\n     [_Saine_, say.]\r\nAnd to read homelies upon holidayes;\r\nWhen that was done, he might attend his playes:\r\nAn easie life, and fit high God to please.                           395\r\nHe, having overlookt their pas at ease,\r\nGan at the length them to rebuke againe,\r\nThat no good trade of life did entertaine,\r\nBut lost their time in wandring loose abroad;\r\nSeeing the world, in which they bootles boad,                        400\r\n     [_Bootless boad_, dwelt unprofitably.]\r\nHad wayes enough for all therein to live;\r\nSuch grace did God unto his creatures give.\r\nSaid then the Foxe: \"Who hath the world not tride\r\nFrom the right way full eath may wander wide.\r\n     [_Eath_, easy.]\r\nWe are but novices, new come abroad,                                 405\r\nWe have

good speed and well to fare:                    550\r\nSo parted they, as eithers way them led.\r\nBut th'Ape and Foxe ere long so well them sped,\r\nThrough the priests holesome counsell lately tought,\r\nAnd throgh their owne faire handling wisely wroght,\r\nThat they a benefice twixt them obtained,                            555\r\nAnd craftie Reynold was a priest ordained,\r\nAnd th'Ape his parish clarke procur'd to bee:\r\nThen made they revell route and goodly glee.\r\nBut, ere long time had passed, they so ill\r\nDid order their affaires, that th'evill will                         560\r\nOf all their parishners they had constraind;\r\nWho to the ordinarie of them complain'd,\r\nHow fowlie they their offices abusd,\r\nAnd them of crimes and heresies accusd;\r\nThat pursivants he often for them sent.                              565\r\nBut they neglected his commaundement;\r\nSo long persisted obstinate and bolde,\r\nTill at the length he published to holde\r\nA visitation, and them cyted thether.\r\nThen was high time their wits about to geather;                      570\r\nWhat did they then, but made a composition\r\nWith their next neighbor priest for light condition,\r\nTo whom their living they resigned quight\r\nFor a few pence, and ran away by night.\r\nSo passing through the countrey in disguize,                         575\r\nThey fled farre off, where none might them surprize,\r\nAnd after that long straied here and there,\r\nThrough everie field and forrest farre and nere;\r\nYet never found occasion for their tourne,\r\nBut, almost sterv'd, did much lament and mourne.                     580\r\nAt last they chaunst to meete upon the way\r\nThe Mule, all deckt in goodly rich aray,\r\nWith bells and bosses that full lowdly rung,\r\nAnd costly trappings that to ground downe hung.\r\nLowly they him saluted in meeke wise;                                585\r\nBut he through pride and fatnes gan despise\r\nTheir meanesse; scarce vouchsafte them to requite.\r\nWhereat the Foxe deep groning in his sprite,\r\nSaid: \"Ah!

 610\r\nThat hath not seene that heavens portracture.\r\nBut tidings there is none, I you assure,\r\nSave that which common is, and knowne to all,\r\nThat courtiers as the tide doo rise and

moe.\"\r\n\"But,\" said the Ape, \"how shall we first come in,\r\nThat after we may favour seeke to win?\"\r\n\"How els,\" said he, \"but with a good bold face,                      645\r\nAnd with big words, and with a stately pace,\r\nThat men may thinke of you in generall\r\nThat to be in you which is not at all:\r\nFor not by that which is the world now deemeth,\r\n(As it was wont) but by

decorate.]\r\nFor thither they themselves meant to addresse,\r\nIn hope to finde there happier successe.\r\nSo well they shifted, that the Ape anon\r\nHimselfe had cloathed like a gentleman,                              660\r\nAnd the slie Foxe as like to be his groome;\r\nThat to the court in seemly sort they come.\r\nWhere the fond Ape, himselfe uprearing by\r\nUpon his tiptoes, stalketh stately by,\r\nAs if he were some great magnifico,                                  665\r\nAnd boldlie doth amongst the boldest go;\r\nAnd his man Reynold, with fine counterfesaunce,\r\n     [_Counterfesaunce_, counterfeiting.]\r\nSupports his credite and his countenaunce.\r\nThen gan the courtiers gaze on everie side,\r\nAnd stare on him with big looks basen wide,                          670\r\n     [_Basen_, swelled.]\r\nWondring what mister wight he was, and whence;\r\n     [_Mister wight_, sort of creature.]\r\nFor he was clad in strange accoustrements,\r\nFashion'd with queint devises never seene\r\nIn court before, yet there all fashions beene;\r\nYet he them in newfanglenesse did pas.                               675\r\nBut his behaviour altogether was\r\n_Alla Turchesca,_ much the more admyr'd;\r\n     [_Alla Turchesca_, in the Turkish fashion.]\r\nAnd his lookes loftie, as if he aspyr'd\r\nTo dignitie, and sdeign'd the low degree;\r\nThat all which did such strangenesse in him see                      680\r\nBy secrete meanes gan of his state enquire,\r\nAnd privily his servant thereto hire:\r\nWho, throughly arm'd against such coverture,\r\n     [_Coverture_, underhand dealing.]\r\nReported unto all that he was sure\r\nA noble gentleman of high regard,                                    685\r\nWhich through the world had with long travel far'd,\r\nAnd seene the manners of all beasts on ground,\r\nNow here arriv'd to see if like he found.\r\nThus did the Ape at first him credit gaine,\r\nWhich afterwards he wisely did maintaine                             690\r\nWith gallant showe, and daylie more augment\r\nThrough his fine feates and courtly complement;\r\nFor he could play, and daunce, and vaute, and spring,\r\nAnd all that els pertaines to reveling.\r\nOnely through kindly aptnes of his ioynts.                           695\r\n     [_Kindly_, natural.]\r\nBesides he could doo manie other poynts,\r\nThe which in court him served to good stead:\r\nFor he mongst ladies could their fortunes read\r\nOut of their hands, and merie leasings tell,\r\nAnd iuggle finely, that became him well.                             700\r\nBut he so light was at legierdemaine,\r\nThat what he toucht came not to light againe;\r\nYet would he laugh it out, and proudly looke,\r\nAnd tell them that they greatly him mistooke.\r\nSo would he scoffe them out with mockcrie,                           705\r\nFor he therein had great felicitie;\r\nAnd with sharp quips ioy'd others to deface,\r\nThinking that their disgracing did him grace:\r\nSo whilst that other like vaine wits he pleased\r\nAnd made to laugh, his heart was greatly eased.                      710\r\nBut the right gentle minde woulde bite his lip,\r\nTo heare the iavell so good men to nip:\r\n     [_Iavell_, worthless fellow.]\r\nFor, though the vulgar yeeld an open eare,\r\nAnd common courtiers love to gybe and fleare\r\nAt everie thing which they heare spoken ill,                         715\r\nAnd the best speaches with ill meaning spill,\r\n     [_Spill_, spoil.]\r\nYet the brave courtier, in whose beauteous thought\r\nRegard of honour harbours more than ought,\r\nDoth loath such base condition, to backbite\r\n     [_Condition_, quality.]\r\nAnies good name for envie or despite.                                720\r\nHe stands on tearmes of honourable minde,\r\nNe will be carried with the common winde\r\nOf courts inconstant mutabilitie,\r\nNe after everie tattling fable flie;\r\nBut heares and sees the follies of the rest,                         725\r\nAnd thereof gathers for himselfe the best.\r\nHe will not creepe, nor crouche with fained face,\r\nBut walkes upright with comely stedfast pace,\r\nAnd unto all doth yeeld due curtesie;\r\nBut not with kissed hand belowe the knee,                            730\r\nAs that same apish crue is wont to doo:\r\nFor he disdaines himselfe t'embase theretoo.\r\nHe hates fowle leasings and vile flatterie,\r\nTwo filthie blots in noble gentrie;\r\nAnd lothefull idlenes he doth detest,                                735\r\nThe canker worme of everie gentle brest;\r\nThe which to banish with faire exercise\r\nOf knightly feates he daylie doth devise:\r\nNow menaging the mouthes of stubborne steedes,\r\nNow practising the proofe of warlike deedes,                         740\r\nNow his bright armes assaying, now his speare,\r\nNow the nigh aymed ring away to beare:\r\nAt other times he casts to sew the chace\r\n     [_Casts_, plans, makes arrangements.]\r\nOf Swift wilde beasts, or runne on foote a race,\r\nT'enlarge his breath, (large breath in armes most needfull,)         745\r\nOr els by wrestling to wex strong and heedfull,\r\nOr his stiffe armes to stretch with eughen bowe,\r\n     [_Eughen_, made of yew.]\r\nAnd manly legs, still passing too and fro,\r\nWithout a gowned beast him fast beside;\r\nA vaine ensample of the Persian pride,                               750\r\nWho after he had wonne th'Assyrian foe,\r\nDid ever after scorne on foote to goe.\r\nThus when this courtly gentleman with toyle\r\nHimselfe hath wearied, he doth recoyle\r\nUnto his rest, and there with sweete delight                         755\r\nOf musicks skill revives his toyled spright;\r\nOr els with loves and ladies gentle sports,\r\nThe ioy of youth, himselfe he recomforts:\r\nOr lastly, when the bodie list to pause,\r\nHis minde unto the Muses he withdrawes,                              760\r\nSweete Ladie Muses, ladies of delight,\r\nDelights of life, and ornaments of light:\r\nWith whom he close confers with wise discourse,\r\nOf Natures workes, of heavens continuall course,\r\nOf forreine lands, of people different,                              765\r\nOf kingdomes change, of divers gouvernment,\r\nOf dreadfull battailes of renowmed knights;\r\nWith which he kindleth his ambitious sprights\r\nTo like desire and praise of noble fame,\r\nThe onely upshot whereto he doth ayme.                               770\r\nFor all his minde on honour fixed is,\r\nTo which he levels all his purposis,\r\nAnd in his Princes service spends his dayes,\r\nNot so much for to game, or for to raise\r\nHimselfe to high degree, as for his grace,                           775\r\nAnd in his liking to winne worthie place,\r\nThrough due deserts and comely carriage,\r\nIn whatso please employ his personage,\r\nThat may be matter meete to game him praise.\r\nFor he is fit to use in all assayes,                                 780\r\nWhether for armes and warlike amenaunce,\r\n     [_Amenaunce_, conduct.]\r\nOr else for wise and civill governaunce;\r\nFor he is practiz'd well in policie,\r\nAnd thereto doth his courting most applie:\r\n     [_Courting_, life at court.]\r\nTo learne the enterdeale of princes strange,                         785\r\n     [_Enterdeale_, dealing together.]\r\nTo marke th'intent of counsells, and the

                   790\r\nWhich through wise speaches and grave conference\r\nHe daylie eekes, and brings to excellence.\r\n     [_Eekes_, increases.]\r\nSuch is the rightfull courtier in his kinde:\r\nBut unto such the Ape lent not his minde;\r\nSuch were for him no fit companions,                                 795\r\nSuch would descrie his lewd conditions:\r\nBut the yong lustie gallants he did chose\r\nTo follow, meete to whom he might disclose\r\nHis witlesse pleasance and ill pleasing vaine.\r\nA thousand wayes he them could entertaine,                           800\r\nWith all the thriftles games that may be found;\r\nWith mumming and with masking all around,\r\nWith dice, with cards, with balliards farre unfit,\r\n     [_Balliards_, billiards.]\r\nWith shuttelcocks, misseeming manlie wit,\r\n     [_Misseeming_, unbecoming.]\r\nWith courtizans, and costly riotize,                                 805\r\nWhereof still somewhat to his share did rize:\r\nNe, them to pleasure, would he sometimes scorne\r\nA pandares coate (so basely was he borne);\r\nThereto he could fine loving verses frame,\r\nAnd play the poet oft. But ah! for shame,                            810\r\nLet not sweete poets praise, whose onely pride\r\nIs vertue to advaunce, and vice deride,\r\nBe with the worke of losels wit defamed,\r\nNe let such verses poetrie be named!\r\nYet he the name on him would rashly take,                            815\r\nMaugre the sacred Muses, and it make\r\nA servant to the vile affection\r\nOf such as he depended most upon;\r\nAnd with the sugrie sweete thereof allure\r\nChast ladies eares to fantasies impure.                              820\r\nTo such delights the noble wits he led\r\nWhich him reliev'd, and their vaine humours fed\r\nWith fruitles folies and unsound delights.\r\nBut if perhaps into their noble sprights\r\nDesire of honor or brave thought of armes                            825\r\nDid ever creepe, then with his wicked charmes\r\nAnd strong conceipts he would it drive away,\r\nNe suffer it to house there halfe a day.\r\nAnd whenso love of letters did inspire\r\nTheir

whom they professe?\r\nBut what car'd he for God, or godlinesse?\r\nAll his care was himselfe how to advaunce,                           845\r\nAnd to uphold his courtly countenaunce\r\nBy all the cunning meanes he could devise;\r\n\"Were it by honest wayes, or otherwise,\r\nHe made small choyce: yet sure his honestie\r\nGot him small gaines, but shameles flatterie,

sustain'd,\r\nWas his man Raynolds purchase which he gain'd:\r\n     [_Purchase_, booty.]\r\nFor he was school'd by kinde in all the skill                        855\r\n     [_Kinde_, nature.]\r\nOf close conveyance, and each practise ill\r\nOf coosinage and cleanly knaverie,\r\n     [_Cleanly_, neat, skillful.]\r\nWhich oft maintain'd his masters braverie.\r\nBesides, he usde another slipprie

hide\r\nHis craftie feates, but that they were descride                      920\r\nAt length by such as sate in iustice seate,\r\nWho for the same him fowlie did entreate;\r\nAnd, having worthily him punished,\r\nOut of the court for ever banished.\r\nAnd now the Ape, wanting his huckster man,                           925\r\nThat wont provide his necessaries, gan\r\nTo growe into great lacke, ne could upholde\r\nHis countenaunce in those his garments olde;\r\nNe new ones could he easily provide,\r\nThough all men him uncased gan deride,                               930\r\nLike as a puppit placed in a play,\r\nWhose part once past all men bid take away:\r\nSo that he driven was to great distresse,\r\nAnd shortly brought to hopelesse wretchednesse.\r\nThen closely as he might he cast to leave                            935\r\nThe court, not asking any passe or leave;\r\nBut ran away in his rent rags by night,\r\nNe ever stayd in place, ne spake to wight,\r\nTill that the Foxe, his copesmate, he had found;\r\n     [_Copesmate_, partner in trade.]\r\nTo whome complayning his unhappie stound,                            940\r\n     [_Stound_, plight, exigency.]\r\nAt last againe with him in travell ioynd,\r\nAnd with him far'd some better chaunee to fynde.\r\nSo in the world long time they wandered,\r\nAnd mickle want and hardnesse suffered;\r\nThat them repented much so foolishly                                 945\r\nTo come so farre to seeke for misery,\r\nAnd leave the sweetnes of contented home,\r\nThough eating hipps and drinking watry fome.\r\n     [_Hipps_, dog-rose berries.]\r\nThus as they them complayned too and fro,\r\nWhilst through the forest rechlesse they did goe,                    950\r\n     [_Rechlesse_, reckless.]\r\nLo! where they spide how in a gloomy glade\r\nThe Lyon sleeping lay in secret shade,\r\nHis crowne and scepter lying him beside,\r\nAnd having doft for heate his dreadfull hide:\r\nWhich when they saw, the Ape was sore afrayde,                       955\r\nAnd would have fled with terror all dismayde.\r\nBut him the Foxe with hardy words did stay,\r\nAnd bad him put all cowardize away;\r\nFor now was time, if ever they would hope,\r\nTo ayme their counsels to the fairest scope,                         960\r\nAnd them for ever highly to advaunce,\r\nIn case the good which their owne happie chaunce\r\nThem freely offred they would wisely take.\r\nScarse could the Ape yet speake, so did he quake;\r\nYet, as he could, he askt how good might growe                       965\r\nWhere nought but dread and death do seeme in show.\r\n\"Now,\" sayd he, \"whiles the Lyon sleepeth sound,\r\nMay we his crowne and mace take from the ground,\r\nAnd eke his skinne, the terror of the wood,\r\nWherewith we may our selves, if we thinke good,                      970\r\nMake kings of beasts, and lords of forests all\r\nSubiect unto that powre imperiall.\"\r\n\"Ah! but,\" sayd the Ape, \"who is so bold a wretch,\r\nThat dare his hardy hand to those outstretch,\r\nWhen as he knowes his meede, if he be spide,                         975\r\nTo be a thousand deathes, and shame beside?\"\r\n\"Fond Ape!\" sayd then the Foxe, \"into whose brest\r\nNever crept thought of honor nor brave gest,\r\n     [_Gest_, deed.]\r\nWho will not venture life a king to be,\r\nAnd rather rule and raigne in soveraign see,                         980\r\nThan dwell in dust inglorious and bace,\r\nWhere none shall name the number of his place?\r\nOne ioyous howre in blisfull happines,\r\nI chose before a life of wretchednes.\r\nBe therefore counselled herein by me,                                985\r\nAnd shake off this vile-harted cowardree.\r\nIf he awake, yet is not death the next,\r\nFor we may colour it with some pretext\r\nOf this or that, that may excuse the cryme:\r\nElse we may flye; thou to a tree mayst clyme,                        990\r\nAnd I creepe under ground; both from his reach:\r\nTherefore be rul'd to doo as I doo teach.\"\r\nThe Ape, that earst did nought but chill and quake,\r\nNow gan some courage unto him to take,\r\nAnd was content to attempt that enterprise,                          995\r\nTickled with glorie and rash covetise.\r\nBut first gan question, whether should assay\r\n     [_Whether_, which of the two.]\r\nThose royall ornaments to steale away?\r\n\"Marie, that shall your selfe,\" quoth he theretoo,\r\n\"For ye be fine and nimble it to doo;                               1000\r\nOf all the beasts which in the forrests bee\r\nIs not a fitter for this turne than yee:\r\nTherefore, mine owne deare brother, take good hart,\r\nAnd ever thinke a kingdome is your part.\"\r\nLoath was the Ape, though praised, to adventer,                     1005\r\nYet faintly gan into his worke to enter,\r\nAfraid of everie leafe that stir'd him by,\r\nAnd everie stick that underneath did ly:\r\nUpon his tiptoes nicely he up went,\r\nFor making noyse, and still his eare he lent                        1010\r\nTo everie sound that under heaven blew;\r\nNow went, now stopt, now crept, now backward drew,\r\nThat it good sport had been him to have eyde.\r\nYet at the last, so well he him applyde,\r\nThrough his fine handling and cleanly play                          1015\r\nHe all those royall signes had stolne away,\r\nAnd with the Foxes helpe them borne aside\r\nInto a secret corner unespide.\r\nWhither whenas they came they fell at words,\r\nWhether of them should be the lords of lords:                       1020\r\nFor th'Ape was stryfull and ambicious,\r\nAnd the Foxe guilefull and most covetous;\r\nThat neither pleased was to have the rayne\r\nTwixt them divided into even twaine,\r\nBut either algates would be lords alone:                            1025\r\n     [_Algates_, by all means.]\r\nFor love and lordship bide no paragone.\r\n     [_Paragone_, equal, partner.]\r\n\"I am most worthie,\" said the Ape, \"sith I\r\nFor it did put my life in ieopardie:\r\nThereto I am in person and in stature\r\nMost like a man, the lord of everie creature,                       1030\r\nSo that it seemeth I was made to raigne,\r\nAnd borne to be a kingly soveraigne.\"\r\n\"Nay,\" said the Foxe, \"Sir Ape, you are astray;\r\nFor though to steale the diademe away\r\nWere the worke of your nimble hand, yet I                           1035\r\nDid first devise the plot by pollicie;\r\nSo that it wholly springeth from my wit:\r\nFor which also I claime my selfe more fit\r\nThan you to rule: for government of state\r\nWill without wisedome soone be ruinate.                             1040\r\nAnd where ye claime your selfe for outward shape\r\nMost like a man, man is not like an ape\r\nIn his chiefe parts, that is, in wit and spirite;\r\nBut I therein most like to him doo merite,\r\nFor my slie wyles and subtill craftinesse,                          1045\r\nThe title of the kingdome to possesse.\r\nNath'les, my brother, since we passed are\r\nUnto this point, we will appease our iarre;\r\nAnd I with reason meete will rest content,\r\nThat ye shall have both crowne and government,                      1050\r\nUpon condition that ye ruled bee\r\nIn all affaires, and counselled by mee;\r\nAnd that ye let none other ever drawe\r\nYour minde from me, but keepe this as a lawe:\r\nAnd hereupon an oath unto me plight.\"                               1055\r\nThe Ape was glad to end the strife so light,\r\nAnd thereto swore: for who would not oft sweare,\r\nAnd oft unsweare, a diademe to beare?\r\nThen freely up those royall spoyles he tooke,\r\nYet at the Lyons skin he inly quooke;                               1060\r\nBut it dissembled, and upon his head\r\nThe crowne, and on his backe the skin, he did,\r\nAnd the false Foxe him helped to array.\r\nThen when he was all dight he tooke his way\r\nInto the forest, that he might be seene                             1065\r\nOf the wilde beasts in his new glory sheene.\r\nThere the two first whome he encountred were\r\nThe Sheepe and th'Asse, who, striken both with feare\r\nAt sight of him, gan fast away to flye;\r\nBut unto them the Foxe alowd did cry,                               1070\r\nAnd in the kings name bad them both to stay,\r\nUpon the payne that thereof follow may.\r\nHardly naythles were they restrayned so,\r\nTill that the Foxe forth toward them did goe,\r\nAnd there disswaded them from needlease feare,                      1075\r\nFor that the King did favour to them beare;\r\nAnd therefore dreadles bad them come to corte;\r\nFor no wild beasts should do them any torte\r\n     [_Torte_, wrong.]\r\nThere or abroad, ne would his Maiestye\r\nUse them but well, with gracious clemencye,                         1080\r\nAs whome he knew to him both fast and true.\r\nSo he perswaded them with homage due\r\nThemselves to humble to the Ape prostrate,\r\nWho, gently to them bowing in his gate,\r\n     [_Gate_, way.]\r\nReceyved them with chearefull entertayne.                           1085\r\nThenceforth proceeding with his princely trayne,\r\nHe shortly met the Tygre, and the Bore,\r\nWhich with the simple Camell raged sore\r\nIn bitter words, seeking to take occasion\r\nUpon his fleshly corpse to make invasion:                           1090\r\nBut soone as they this mock-king did espy,\r\nTheir troublous strife they stinted by and by,\r\n     [_Stinted by and by_, stopped at once.]\r\nThinking indeed that it the Lyon was.\r\nHe then, to prove whether his powre would pas\r\nAs currant, sent the Foxe to them streight way,                     1095\r\nCommaunding them their cause of strife bewray;\r\nAnd, if that wrong on eyther side there were,\r\nThat he should warne the wronger to appeare\r\nThe morrow next at court, it to defend;\r\nIn the meane time upon the King t'attend.                           1100\r\nThe subtile Foxe so well his message sayd,\r\nThat the proud beasts him readily obayd:\r\nWhereby the Ape in wondrous stomack woxe,\r\nStrongly encorag'd by the crafty Foxe;\r\nThat king indeed himselfe he shortly thought,                       1105\r\nAnd all the beasts him feared as they ought,\r\nAnd followed unto his palaice hye;\r\nWhere taking conge, each one by and by\r\nDeparted to his home in dreadfull awe,\r\nFull of the feared sight which late they sawe.                      1110\r\nThe Ape, thus seized of the regall throne,\r\nEftsones by counsell of the Foxe alone\r\nGan to provide for all things in assurance,\r\nThat so his rule might lenger have endurance.\r\nFirst, to his gate be pointed a strong gard,                        1115\r\nThat none might enter but with issue hard:\r\nThen, for the safegard of his personage,\r\nHe did appoint a warlike equipage\r\nOf forreine beasts, not in the forest bred,\r\nBut part by land and part by water fed;                             1120\r\nFor tyrannie is with strange ayde supported.\r\nThen unto him all monstrous beasts resorted\r\nBred of two kindes, as Griffons, Minotaures,\r\nCrocodiles, Dragons, Beavers, and Centaures:\r\nWith those himselfe he strengthned mightelie,                       1125\r\nThat feare he neede no force of enemie.\r\nThen gan he rule and tyrannize at will,\r\nLike as the Foxe did guide his graceles skill;\r\nAnd all wylde beasts made vassals of his pleasures,\r\nAnd with their spoyles enlarg'd his private treasures.\r\nNo care of iustice, nor no rule of reason,                          1131\r\nNo temperance, nor no regard of season,\r\nDid thenceforth ever enter in his minde;\r\nBut crueltie, the signe of currish kinde,\r\nAnd sdeignfull pride, and wilfull arrogaunce;                       1135\r\nSuch followes those whom fortune doth advaunce.\r\nBut the false Foxe most kindly plaid his part:\r\n     [_Kindly_, according to his nature.]\r\nFor whatsoever mother-wit or arte\r\nCould worke, he put in proofe: no practise slie,\r\nNo counterpoint of cunning policie,                                 1140\r\n     [_Counterpoint_, counterplot.]\r\nNe reach, no breach, that might him profit bring,\r\nBut he the same did to his purpose wring.\r\nNought suffered he the Ape to give or graunt,\r\nBut through his hand must passe the fiaunt.\r\n     [_Fiaunt_, fiat.]\r\nAll offices, all leases by him lept,                                1145\r\nAnd of them all whatso he likte he kept.\r\nIustice he solde iniustice for to buy,\r\nAnd for to purchase for his progeny.\r\n     [_Purchase_, collect spoil.]\r\nIll might it prosper that ill gotten was,\r\nBut, so he got it, little did he pas.                               1150\r\n     [_Pas_, care.]\r\nHe fed his cubs with fat of all the soyle,\r\nAnd with the sweete of others sweating toyle;\r\nHe crammed them with crumbs of benefices,\r\nAnd fild their mouthes with meeds of malefices;\r\n     [_Malifices_, evil deeds.]\r\nHe cloathed them with all colours save white,                       1155\r\nAnd loded them with lordships and with might,\r\nSo much as they were able well to beare,\r\nThat with the weight their backs nigh broken were.\r\nHe chaffred chayres in which churchmen were set,\r\n     [_Chaffred_, bartered.]\r\nAnd breach of lawes to privie ferme did let.                        1160\r\n     [_Ferme_, farm.]\r\nNo statute so established might bee,\r\nNor ordinaunce so needfull, but that hee\r\nWould violate, though not with violence,\r\nYet under colour of the confidence\r\nThe which the Ape repos'd in him alone,                             1165\r\nAnd reckned him the kingdomes corner stone.\r\nAnd ever, when he ought would bring to pas,\r\nHis long experience the platforme was:\r\nAnd when he ought not pleasing would put by\r\nThe cloke was care of thrift, and husbandry,                        1170\r\nFor to encrease the common treasures store.\r\nBut his owne treasure he encreased more,\r\nAnd lifted up his loftie towres thereby,\r\nThat they began to threat the neighbour sky;\r\nThe whiles the princes pallaces fell fast                           1175\r\nTo ruine; for what thing can ever last?\r\nAnd whilest the other peeres for povertie\r\nWere forst their auncient houses to let lie,\r\nAnd their olde castles to the ground to fall,\r\nWhich their forefathers famous over-all                             1180\r\n     [_Over-all_, everywhere.]\r\nHad founded for the kingdomes ornament,\r\nAnd for their memories long moniment.\r\nBut he no count made of nobilitie,\r\nNor the wilde beasts whom armes did glorifie,                       1185\r\nThe realmes chiefe strength and girlond of the crowne.\r\nAll these through fained crimes he thrust adowne,\r\nOr made them dwell in darknes of disgrace:\r\nFor none but whom he list might come in place.\r\nOf men of armes he had but small regard,\r\nBut kept them lowe, and streigned verie hard.                       1190\r\nFor men of learning little he esteemed;\r\nHis wisedome he above their learning deemed.\r\nAs for the rascall commons, least he cared,\r\nFor not so common was his bountie shared:                           1194\r\n\"Let God,\" said he, \"if please, care for the manie,\r\nI for my selfe must care before els anie.\"\r\nSo did he good to none, to manie ill,\r\nSo did he all the kingdome rob and pill,\r\n     [_Pill_, plunder.]\r\nYet none durst speake, ne none durst of him plaine;\r\nSo great he was in grace, and rich through game.\r\nNe would he anie let to have accesse                                1201\r\nUnto the Prince, but by his owne addresse:\r\nFor all that els did come were sure to faile;\r\nYet would he further none but for availe.\r\nFor on a time the Sheepe, to whom of yore                           1205\r\nThe Foxe had promised of friendship store,\r\nWhat time the Ape the kingdome first did gaine,\r\nCame to the court, her case there to complaine;\r\nHow that the Wolfe, her mortall enemie,\r\nHad sithence slaine her lambe most cruellie;                        1210\r\n     [_Sithence_, since.]\r\nAnd therefore crav'd to come unto the King,\r\nTo let him knowe the order of the thing.\r\n\"Soft, Gooddie

on,\r\nMaking them thinke it but a vision.\r\nThrough power of that he runnes through enemies swerds;\r\nThrough power of that he passeth through the herds\r\nOf ravenous wilde beasts, and doth

          1300\r\nBoth through the gard, which never him descride,\r\nAnd through the watchmen, who him never spide:\r\nThenceforth he past into each secrete part,\r\nWhereas he saw, that sorely

infinite extortions,\r\nDone through the Foxes great oppressions,\r\nThat the complaints thereof could not be tolde.\r\nWhich when he did with lothfull eyes beholde,\r\nHe would no more endure, but came his way,                          1315\r\nAnd cast to seeke the Lion, where he may,\r\n     [_Cast_, projected.]\r\nThat he might worke the avengement for this shame\r\nOn those two caytives

therein\r\nFled fast away from that so dreadfull din.\r\nAt last he came unto his mansion,\r\nWhere all the gates he found fast lockt anon                        1350\r\nAnd manie warders round about them stood:\r\nWith that he roar'd alowd, as he were wood,\r\n     [_Wood_, frantic.]\r\nThat all the pallace quaked at the stound,\r\n     [_Stound_, (time, scene) tumult.]\r\nAs if it quite were

sought.\r\nTo hide himselfe from his owne feared thought.\r\nBut the false Foxe, when he the Lion heard,\r\nFled closely forth, streightway of death afeard,                    1360\r\n     [_Closely_,

him at last the Lyon spide, and caught,                         1375\r\nAnd forth with shame unto his iudgement brought.\r\nThen all the beasts he causd' assembled bee,\r\nTo heare their doome, and

We cannot be sure of the year, but we\r\nknow, from the 266th verse of the Epithalamion, that the day was the\r\nfeast of St. Barnabas, June 11 of the Old Style. In the 74th sonnet we\r\nare directly told that the lady's name was Elizabeth. In the 61st, she\r\nis said to be of the \"Brood of Angels, heavenly born.\" From this and\r\nmany similar expressions, interpreted by the laws of Anagram, and taken\r\nin conjunction with various circumstances which do not require to be\r\nstated here, it may be inferred that her surname was Nagle.

Nor did ISRAEL scape\r\n  Th' infection when their borrow'd Gold compos'd\r\n  The Calf in OREB: and the Rebel King\r\n  Doubl'd that sin in BETHEL and in DAN,\r\n  Lik'ning his Maker to the Grazed Ox,\r\n  JEHOVAH, who in one Night when he pass'd\r\n  From EGYPT marching, equal'd with one stroke\r\n  Both her first born and all her bleating Gods.\r\n  BELIAL came last, then whom a Spirit more lewd\r\n  Fell not from Heaven, or more gross to love\r\n  Vice for it self: To him no Temple stood\r\n  Or Altar smoak'd; yet who more oft then hee\r\n  In Temples and at Altars, when the Priest\r\n  Turns Atheist, as did ELY'S Sons, who fill'd\r\n  With lust and violence the house of God.\r\n  In Courts and Palaces he also Reigns\r\n  And in luxurious Cities, where the noyse\r\n  Of riot ascends above thir loftiest Towrs,\r\n  And injury and outrage: And when Night\r\n  Darkens the Streets, then wander forth the Sons\r\n  Of BELIAL, flown with insolence and wine.\r\n  Witness the Streets of SODOM, and that night\r\n  In GIBEAH, when hospitable Dores\r\n  Yielded thir Matrons to prevent worse rape.\r\n  These were the prime in order and in might;\r\n  The rest were long to tell, though far renown'd,\r\n  Th' IONIAN Gods, of JAVANS Issue held\r\n  Gods, yet confest later then Heav'n and Earth\r\n  Thir boasted Parents; TITAN Heav'ns first born\r\n  With his enormous brood, and birthright seis'd\r\n  By younger SATURN, he from mightier JOVE\r\n  His own and RHEA'S Son like measure found;\r\n  So JOVE usurping reign'd: these first in CREET\r\n  And IDA known, thence on the Snowy top\r\n  Of cold OLYMPUS rul'd the middle Air\r\n  Thir highest Heav'n; or on the DELPHIAN Cliff,\r\n  Or in DODONA, and through all the bounds\r\n  Of DORIC Land; or who with SATURN old\r\n  Fled over ADRIA to th' HESPERIAN Fields,\r\n  And ore the CELTIC roam'd the utmost Isles.\r\n  All these and more came flocking; but with looks\r\n  Down cast and damp, yet such wherein appear'd\r\n  Obscure som glimps of joy, to have found thir chief\r\n  Not in despair, to have found themselves not lost\r\n  In loss it self; which on his count'nance cast\r\n  Like doubtful hue: but he his wonted pride\r\n  Soon recollecting, with high words, that bore\r\n  Semblance of worth not substance, gently rais'd\r\n  Their fainted courage, and dispel'd their fears.\r\n  Then strait commands that at the warlike sound\r\n  Of Trumpets loud and Clarions be upreard\r\n  His mighty Standard; that proud honour claim'd\r\n  AZAZEL as his right, a Cherube tall:\r\n  Who forthwith from the glittering Staff unfurld\r\n  Th' Imperial Ensign, which full high advanc't\r\n  Shon like a Meteor streaming to the Wind\r\n  With Gemms and Golden lustre rich imblaz'd,\r\n  Seraphic arms and Trophies: all the while\r\n  Sonorous mettal blowing Martial sounds:\r\n  At which the universal Host upsent\r\n  A shout that tore Hells Concave, and beyond\r\n  Frighted the Reign of CHAOS and old Night.\r\n  All in a moment through the gloom were seen\r\n  Ten thousand Banners rise into the Air\r\n  With Orient Colours waving: with them rose\r\n  A Forrest huge of Spears: and thronging Helms\r\n  Appear'd, and serried Shields in thick array\r\n  Of depth immeasurable: Anon they move\r\n  In perfect PHALANX to the Dorian mood\r\n  Of Flutes and soft Recorders; such as rais'd\r\n  To highth of noblest temper Hero's old\r\n  Arming to Battel, and in stead of rage\r\n  Deliberate valour breath'd, firm and unmov'd\r\n  With dread of death to flight or foul retreat,\r\n  Nor wanting power to mitigate and swage\r\n  With solemn touches, troubl'd thoughts, and chase\r\n  Anguish and doubt and fear and sorrow and pain\r\n  From mortal or immortal minds.  Thus they\r\n  Breathing united force with fixed thought\r\n  Mov'd on in silence to soft Pipes that charm'd\r\n  Thir painful steps o're the burnt soyle; and now\r\n  Advanc't in view they stand, a horrid Front\r\n  Of dreadful length and dazling Arms, in guise\r\n  Of Warriers old with order'd Spear and Shield,\r\n  Awaiting what command thir mighty Chief\r\n  Had to impose: He through the armed Files\r\n  Darts his experienc't eye, and soon traverse\r\n  The whole Battalion views, thir order due,\r\n  Thir visages and stature as of Gods,\r\n  Thir number last he summs.  And now his heart\r\n  Distends with pride, and hardning in his strength\r\n  Glories: For never since created man,\r\n  Met such imbodied force, as nam'd with these\r\n  Could merit more then that small infantry\r\n  Warr'd on by Cranes: though all the Giant brood\r\n  Of PHLEGRA with th' Heroic Race were joyn'd\r\n  That fought at THEB'S and ILIUM, on each side\r\n  Mixt with auxiliar Gods; and what resounds\r\n  In Fable or ROMANCE of UTHERS Son\r\n  Begirt with BRITISH and ARMORIC Knights;\r\n  And all who since, Baptiz'd or Infidel\r\n  Jousted in ASPRAMONT or MONTALBAN,\r\n  DAMASCO, or MAROCCO, or TREBISOND,\r\n  Or whom BISERTA sent from AFRIC shore\r\n  When CHARLEMAIN with all his Peerage fell\r\n  By FONTARABBIA.  Thus far these beyond\r\n  Compare of mortal prowess, yet observ'd\r\n  Thir dread Commander: he above the rest\r\n  In shape and gesture proudly eminent\r\n  Stood like a Towr; his form had yet not lost\r\n  All her Original brightness, nor appear'd\r\n  Less then Arch Angel ruind, and th' excess\r\n  Of Glory obscur'd: As when the Sun new ris'n\r\n  Looks through the Horizontal misty Air\r\n  Shorn of his Beams, or from behind the Moon\r\n  In dim Eclips disastrous twilight sheds\r\n  On half the Nations, and with fear of change\r\n  Perplexes Monarchs.  Dark'n'd so, yet shon\r\n  Above them all th' Arch Angel: but his face\r\n  Deep scars of Thunder had intrencht, and care\r\n  Sat on his faded cheek, but under Browes\r\n  Of dauntless courage, and considerate Pride\r\n  Waiting revenge: cruel his eye, but cast\r\n  Signs of remorse and passion to behold\r\n  The fellows of his crime, the followers rather\r\n  (Far other once beheld in bliss) condemn'd\r\n  For ever now to have their lot in pain,\r\n  Millions of Spirits for his fault amerc't\r\n  Of Heav'n, and from Eternal Splendors flung\r\n  For his revolt, yet faithfull how they stood,\r\n  Thir Glory witherd.

In fact, he will overrate the relative value of the first good work\r\nby which his attention has been fairly caught. _The Raven_, also, has\r\nconsistent qualities which even an expert must admire. In no other of its\r\nauthor's poems is the motive more palpably defined. \"The Haunted Palace\" is\r\njust as definite to the select reader, but Poe scarcely would have taken\r\nthat subtle allegory for bald analysis. _The Raven_ is wholly occupied with\r\nthe author's typical theme--the irretrievable loss of an idolized and\r\nbeautiful woman; but on other grounds, also, the public instinct is correct\r\nin thinking it his representative poem.\r", "bookID": "17192"}, {"text": "A man of genius usually gains a footing with the success of some one\r\neffort, and this is not always his greatest. Recognition is the more\r\ninstant for having been postponed. He does not acquire it, like a miser's\r\nfortune, coin after coin, but \"not at all or all in all.\" And thus with\r\nother ambitions: the courtier, soldier, actor,--whatever their parts,--each\r\ncounts his triumph from some lucky stroke. Poe's Raven, despite augury, was\r\nfor him \"the bird that made the breeze to blow.\" The poet settled in\r\nNew-York, in the winter of 1844-'45, finding work upon Willis's paper, \"The\r\nEvening Mirror,\" and eking out his income by contributions elsewhere. For\r\nsix years he had been an active writer, and enjoyed a professional\r\nreputation; was held in both respect and misdoubt, and was at no loss for\r\nhis share of the ill-paid journalism of that day. He also had done much of\r\nhis very best work,--such tales as \"Ligeia\" and \"The Fall of the House of\r\nUsher,\" (the latter containing that mystical counterpart, in verse, of\r\nElihu Vedder's \"A Lost Mind,\") such analytic feats as \"The Gold Bug\" and\r\n\"The Mystery of Marie Roget.\" He had made proselytes abroad, and gained a\r\nlasting hold upon the French mind. He had learned his own power and\r\nweakness, and was at his prime, and not without a certain reputation. But\r\nhe had written nothing that was on the tongue of everybody. To rare and\r\ndelicate work some popular touch must be added to capture the general\r\naudience of one's own time.\r", "bookID": "17192"}, {"text": "Through the industry of Poe's successive biographers, the hit made by _The\r\nRaven_ has become an oft-told tale. The poet's young wife, Virginia, was\r\nfading before his eyes, but lingered for another year within death's\r\nshadow. The long, low chamber in the house near the Bloomingdale Road is\r\nas famous as the room where Rouget de l'Isle composed the Marseillaise.\r\nAll have heard that the poem, signed \"Quarles,\" appeared in the \"American\r\nReview,\" with a pseudo-editorial comment on its form; that Poe received ten\r\ndollars for it; that Willis, the kindest and least envious of fashionable\r\narbiters, reprinted it with a eulogy that instantly made it town-talk. All\r\ndoubt of its authorship was dispelled when Poe recited it himself at a\r\nliterary gathering, and for a time he was the most marked of American\r\nauthors. The hit stimulated and encouraged him. Like another and prouder\r\nsatirist, he too found \"something of summer\" even \"in the hum of insects.\"\r\nSorrowfully enough, but three years elapsed,--a period of influence, pride,\r\nanguish, yet always of imaginative or critical labor,--before the final\r\ndefeat, before the curtain dropped on a life that for him was in truth a\r\ntragedy, and he yielded to \"the Conqueror Worm.\"\r", "bookID": "17192"}, {"text": "\"The American Review: A Whig Journal\" was a creditable magazine for the\r\ntime, double-columned, printed on good paper with clear type, and\r\nillustrated by mezzotint portraits. Amid much matter below the present\r\nstandard, it contained some that any editor would be glad to receive. The\r\ninitial volume, for 1845, has articles by Horace Greeley, Donald Mitchell,\r\nWalter Whitman, Marsh, Tuckerman, and Whipple. Ralph Hoyt's quaint poem,\r\n\"Old,\" appeared in this volume. And here are three lyrics by Poe: \"The City\r\nin the Sea,\" \"The Valley of Unrest,\" and _The Raven_. Two of these were\r\nbuilt up,--such was his way,--from earlier studies, but the last-named came\r\nout as if freshly composed, and almost as we have it now. The statement\r\nthat it was not afterward revised is erroneous. Eleven trifling changes\r\nfrom the magazine-text appear in _The Raven and Other Poems_, 1845, a book\r\nwhich the poet shortly felt encouraged to offer the public. These are\r\nmostly changes of punctuation, or of single words, the latter kind made to\r\nheighten the effect of alliteration. In Mr. Lang's pretty edition of Poe's\r\nverse, brought out in the \"Parchment Library,\" he has shown the instinct of\r\na scholar, and has done wisely, in going back to the text in the volume\r\njust mentioned, as given in the London issue of 1846. The \"standard\"\r\nGriswold collection of the poet's works abounds with errors. These have\r\nbeen repeated by later editors, who also have made errors of their own. But\r\nthe text of _The Raven_, owing to the requests made to the author for\r\nmanuscript copies, was still farther revised by him; in fact, he printed it\r\nin Richmond, just before his death, with the poetic substitution of\r\n\"seraphim whose foot-falls\" for \"angels whose faint foot-falls,\" in the\r\nfourteenth stanza. Our present text, therefore, while substantially that of\r\n1845, is somewhat modified by the poet's later reading, and is, I think,\r\nthe most correct and effective version of this single poem. The most\r\nradical change from the earliest version appeared, however, in the volume\r\nin 1845; the eleventh stanza originally having contained these lines,\r\nfaulty in rhyme and otherwise a blemish on the poem:\r", "bookID": "17192"}, {"text": "It would be well if other, and famous, poets could be as sure of making\r\ntheir changes always improvements. Poe constantly rehandled his scanty show\r\nof verse, and usually bettered it. _The Raven_ was the first of the few\r\npoems which he nearly brought to completion before printing. It may be that\r\nthose who care for poetry lost little by his death. Fluent in prose, he\r\nnever wrote verse for the sake of making a poem. When a refrain of image\r\nhaunted him, the lyric that resulted was the inspiration, as he himself\r\nsaid, of a passion, not of a purpose. This was at intervals so rare as\r\nalmost to justify the Fairfield theory that each was the product of a\r\nnervous crisis.\r", "bookID": "17192"}, {"text": "What, then, gave the poet his clue to _The Raven_? From what misty\r\nfoundation did it rise slowly to a music slowly breathed? As usual, more\r\nthan one thing went to the building of so notable a poem. Considering the\r\nlonger sermons often preached on brief and less suggestive texts, I hope\r\nnot to be blamed for this discussion of a single lyric,--especially one\r\nwhich an artist like Dore has made the subject of prodigal illustration.\r\nUntil recently I had supposed that this piece, and a few which its author\r\ncomposed after its appearance, were exceptional in not having grown from\r\ngerms in his boyish verse. But Mr. Fearing Gill has shown me some\r\nunpublished stanzas by Poe, written in his eighteenth year, and entitled,\r\n\"The Demon of the Fire.\" The manuscript appears to be in the poet's early\r\nhandwriting, and its genuineness is vouched for by the family in whose\r\npossession it has remained for half a century. Besides the plainest germs\r\nof \"The Bells\" and \"The Haunted Palace\" it contains a few lines somewhat\r\nsuggestive of the opening and close of _The Raven_. As to the rhythm of our\r\npoem, a comparison of dates indicates that this was influenced by the\r\nrhythm of \"Lady Geraldine's Courtship.\" Poe was one of the first to honor\r\nMiss Barrett's genius; he inscribed his collected poems to her as \"the\r\nnoblest of her sex,\" and was in sympathy with her lyrical method. The\r\nlines from her love-poem,\r", "bookID": "17192"}, {"text": "Here Poe assumed a privilege for which he roughly censured Longfellow, and\r\nwhich no one ever sought on his own premises without swift detection and\r\nchastisement. In melody and stanzaic form, we shall see that the two poems\r\nare not unlike, but in motive they are totally distinct. The generous\r\npoetess felt nothing but the true originality of the poet. \"This vivid\r\nwriting!\" she exclaimed,--\"this power which is felt!... Our great poet, Mr.\r\nBrowning, author of 'Paracelsus,' &c., is enthusiastic in his admiration of\r\nthe rhythm.\" Mr. Ingram, after referring to \"Lady Geraldine,\" cleverly\r\npoints out another source from which Poe may have caught an impulse. In\r\n1843, Albert Pike, the half-Greek, half-frontiersman, poet of Arkansas, had\r\nprinted in \"The New Mirror,\" for which Poe then was writing, some verses\r\nentitled \"Isadore,\" but since revised by the author and called \"The Widowed\r\nHeart.\" I select from Mr. Pike's revision the following stanza, of which\r\nthe main features correspond with the original version:\r", "bookID": "17192"}, {"text": "    \"Restless I pace our lonely rooms, I play our songs no more,\r\n    The garish sun shines flauntingly upon the unswept floor;\r\n    The mocking-bird still sits and sings, O melancholy strain!\r\n    For my heart is like an autumn-cloud that overflows with rain;\r\n                            Thou art lost to me forever, Isadore!\"\r", "bookID": "17192"}, {"text": "     \"The raven, too, * * * might have been made, more than we now see\r\n     it, a portion of the conception of the fantastic Barnaby. * * * Its\r\n     character might have performed, in regard to that of the idiot,\r\n     much the same part as does, in music, the accompaniment in respect\r\n     to the air.\"\r", "bookID": "17192"}, {"text": "Nevertheless, after pointing out these germs and resemblances, the value of\r\nthis poem still is found in its originality. The progressive music, the\r\nscenic detail and contrasted light and shade,--above all, the spiritual\r\npassion of the nocturn, make it the work of an informing genius. As for the\r\ngruesome bird, he is unlike all the other ravens of his clan, from the \"twa\r\ncorbies\" and \"three ravens\" of the balladists to Barnaby's rumpled \"Grip.\"\r\nHere is no semblance of the cawing rook that haunts ancestral turrets and\r\ntreads the field of heraldry; no boding phantom of which Tickell sang that,\r\nwhen,\r", "bookID": "17192"}, {"text": "Poe's raven is a distinct conception; the incarnation of a mourner's agony\r\nand hopelessness; a sable embodied Memory, the abiding chronicler of doom,\r\na type of the Irreparable. Escaped across the Styx, from \"the Night's\r\nPlutonian shore,\" he seems the imaged soul of the questioner himself,--of\r\nhim who can not, will not, quaff the kind nepenthe, because the memory of\r\nLenore is all that is left him, and with the surcease of his sorrow even\r\nthat would be put aside.\r", "bookID": "17192"}, {"text": "_The Raven_ also may be taken as a representative poem of its author, for\r\nits exemplification of all his notions of what a poem should be. These are\r\nfound in his essays on \"The Poetic Principle,\" \"The Rationale of Verse,\"\r\nand \"The Philosophy of Composition.\" Poe declared that \"in Music, perhaps,\r\nthe soul most nearly attains the great end for which, when inspired by the\r\nPoetic Sentiment, it struggles--the creation of supernal Beauty.... Verse\r\ncannot be better designated than as an inferior or less capable music\"; but\r\nagain, verse which is really the \"Poetry of Words\" is \"The Rhythmical\r\nCreation of Beauty,\"--this and nothing more. The _tone_ of the highest\r\nBeauty is one of Sadness. The most melancholy of topics is Death. This must\r\nbe allied to Beauty. \"The death, then, of a beautiful woman is,\r\nunquestionably, the most poetical topic in the world,--and equally is it\r\nbeyond doubt that the lips best suited for such a topic are those of a\r\nbereaved lover.\" These last expressions are quoted from Poe's whimsical\r\nanalysis of this very poem, but they indicate precisely the general range\r\nof his verse. The climax of \"The Bells\" is the muffled monotone of ghouls,\r\nwho glory in weighing down the human heart. \"Lenore,\" _The Raven_, \"The\r\nSleeper,\" \"To One in Paradise,\" and \"Ulalume\" form a tenebrose\r\nsymphony,--and \"Annabel Lee,\" written last of all, shows that one theme\r\npossessed him to the end. Again, these are all nothing if not musical, and\r\nsome are touched with that quality of the Fantastic which awakes the sense\r\nof awe, and adds a new fear to agony itself. Through all is dimly outlined,\r\nbeneath a shadowy pall, the poet's ideal love,--so often half-portrayed\r\nelsewhere,--the entombed wife of Usher, the Lady Ligeia, in truth the\r\ncounterpart of his own nature. I suppose that an artist's love for one \"in\r\nthe form\" never can wholly rival his devotion to some ideal. The woman near\r\nhim must exercise her spells, be all by turns and nothing long, charm him\r\nwith infinite variety, or be content to forego a share of his allegiance.\r\nHe must be lured by the Unattainable, and this is ever just beyond him in\r\nhis passion for creative art.\r", "bookID": "17192"}, {"text": "Poe, like Hawthorne, came in with the decline of the Romantic school, and\r\nnone delighted more than he to laugh at its calamity. Yet his heart was\r\nwith the romancers and their Oriental or Gothic effects. His invention, so\r\nrich in the prose tales, seemed to desert him when he wrote verse; and his\r\njudgment told him that long romantic poems depend more upon incident than\r\ninspiration,--and that, to utter the poetry of romance, lyrics would\r\nsuffice. Hence his theory, clearly fitted to his own limitations, that \"a\r\n'long poem' is a flat contradiction in terms.\" The components of _The\r\nRaven_ are few and simple: a man, a bird, and the phantasmal memory at a\r\nwoman. But the piece affords a fine display of romantic material. What have\r\nwe? The midnight; the shadowy chamber with its tomes of forgotten lore; the\r\nstudent,--a modern Hieronymus; the raven's tap on the casement; the wintry\r\nnight and dying fire; the silken wind-swept hangings; the dreams and vague\r\nmistrust of the echoing darkness; the black, uncanny bird upon the pallid\r\nbust; the accessories of violet velvet and the gloating lamp. All this\r\nstage effect of situation, light, color, sound, is purely romantic, and\r\neven melodramatic, but of a poetic quality that melodrama rarely exhibits,\r\nand thoroughly reflective of the poet's \"eternal passion, eternal pain.\"\r", "bookID": "17192"}, {"text": "The rhythmical structure of _The Raven_ was sure to make an impression.\r\nRhyme, alliteration, the burden, the stanzaic form, were devised with\r\nsingular adroitness.

Here also he had profited by Miss\r\nBarrett's study of ballads and romaunts in her own and other tongues. A\r\n\"refrain\" is the lure wherewith a poet or a musician holds the wandering\r\near,--the recurrent longing of Nature for the initial strain. I have always\r\nadmired the beautiful refrains of the English songstress,--\"The\r\nNightingales, the Nightingales,\" \"Margret, Margret,\" \"My Heart and I,\"\r\n\"Toll slowly,\" \"The River floweth on,\" \"Pan, Pan is dead,\" etc. She also\r\nemployed what I term the Repetend, in the use of which Poe has excelled all\r\npoets since Coleridge thus revived it:\r", "bookID": "17192"}, {"text": "    \"O happy living things! no tongue\r\n    Their beauty might declare:\r\n    A spring of love gushed from my heart,\r\n    And I blessed them unaware:\r\n    Sure my kind saint took pity on me,\r\n    And I blessed them unaware.\"\r", "bookID": "17192"}, {"text": "Poe created the fifth line of his stanza for the magic of the repetend.

Neither his avowal of\r\ncold-blooded artifice, nor his subsequent avowal to friends that an\r\nexposure of this artifice was only another of his intellectual hoaxes, need\r\nbe wholly credited. If he had designed the complete work in advance, he\r\nscarcely would have made so harsh a prelude of rattle-pan rhymes to the\r\ndelicious melody of the second stanza,--not even upon his theory of the\r\nfantastic. Of course an artist, having perfected a work, sees, like the\r\nfirst Artist, that it is good, and sees why it is good. A subsequent\r\nanalysis, coupled with a disavowal of any sacred fire, readily enough may\r\nbe made. My belief is that the first conception and rough draft of this\r\npoem came as inspiration always comes; that its author then saw how it\r\nmight be perfected, giving it the final touches described in his chapter on\r\nComposition, and that the latter, therefore, is neither wholly false nor\r\nwholly true. The harm of such analysis is that it tempts a novice to fancy\r\nthat artificial processes can supersede imagination. The impulse of genius\r\nis to guard the secrets of its creative hour. Glimpses obtained of the\r\ntoil, the baffled experiments, which precede a triumph, as in the\r\nsketch-work of Hawthorne recently brought to light, afford priceless\r\ninstruction and encouragement to the sincere artist. But one who\r\nvoluntarily exposes his Muse to the gaze of all comers should recall the\r\nfate of King Candaules.\r", "bookID": "17192"}, {"text": "The world still thinks of Poe as a \"luckless man of genius.\" I recently\r\nheard him mentioned as \"one whom everybody seems chartered to misrepresent,\r\ndecry or slander.\" But it seems to me that his ill-luck ended with his\r\npitiable death, and that since then his defence has been persistent, and\r\nhis fame of as steadfast growth as a suffering and gifted author could pray\r\nfor in his hopeful hour. Griswold's decrial and slander turned the current\r\nin his favor. Critics and biographers have come forward with successive\r\nrefutations, with tributes to his character, with new editions of his\r\nworks. His own letters and the minute incidents of his career are before\r\nus; the record, good and bad, is widely known. No appellor has received\r\nmore tender and forgiving judgement. His mishaps in life belonged to his\r\nregion and period, perchance still more to his own infirmity of will.\r\nDoubtless his environment was not one to guard a fine-grained, ill-balanced\r\nnature from perils without and within. His strongest will, to be lord of\r\nhimself, gained for him \"that heritage of woe.\" He confessed himself the\r\nbird's unhappy master, the stricken sufferer of this poem. But his was a\r\nfull share of that dramatic temper which exults in the presage of its own\r\ndoom. There is a delight in playing one's high part: we are all gladiators,\r\ncrying _Ave Imperator!_ To quote Burke's matter of fact: \"In grief the\r\npleasure is still uppermost, and the affliction we suffer has no\r\nresemblance to absolute pain, which is always odious, and which we endeavor\r\nto shake off as soon as possible.\" Poe went farther, and was an artist even\r\nin the tragedy of his career. If, according to his own belief, sadness and\r\nthe vanishing of beauty are the highest poetic themes, and poetic feeling\r\nthe keenest earthly pleasure, then the sorrow and darkness of his broken\r\nlife were not without their frequent compensation.\r", "bookID": "17192"}, {"text": "In the following pages, we have a fresh example of an artist's genius\r\ncharacterizing his interpretation of a famous poem. Gustave Dore, the last\r\nwork of whose pencil is before us, was not the painter, or even the\r\ndraughtsman, for realists demanding truth of tone, figure, and perfection.\r\nSuch matters concerned him less than to make shape and distance, light and\r\nshade, assist his purpose,--which was to excite the soul, the imagination,\r\nof the looker on. This he did by arousing our sense of awe, through\r\nmarvellous and often sublime conceptions of things unutterable and full of\r\ngloom or glory. It is well said that if his works were not great paintings,\r\nas pictures they are great indeed. As a \"literary artist,\" and such he was,\r\nhis force was in direct ratio with the dramatic invention of his author,\r\nwith the brave audacities of the spirit that kindled his own. Hence his\r\nsuccess with Rabelais, with \"Le Juif-Errant,\" \"Les Contes Drolatiques,\" and\r\n\"Don Quixote,\" and hence, conversely, his failure to express the beauty of\r\nTennyson's Idyls, of \"Il Paradiso,\" of the Hebrew pastorals, and other\r\ntexts requiring exaltation, or sweetness and repose. He was a born master\r\nof the grotesque, and by a special insight could portray the spectres of a\r\nhaunted brain. We see objects as his personages saw them, and with the very\r\neyes of the Wandering Jew, the bewildered Don, or the goldsmith's daughter\r\nwhose fancy so magnifies the King in the shop on the Pont-au-Change. It was\r\nin the nature of things that he should be attracted to each masterpiece of\r\nverse or prose that I have termed unique. The lower kingdoms were called\r\ninto his service; his rocks, trees and mountains, the sky itself, are\r\nanimate with motive and diablerie. Had he lived to illustrate Shakespeare,\r\nwe should have seen a remarkable treatment of Caliban, the Witches, the\r\nstorm in \"Lear\"; but doubtless should have questioned his ideals of Imogen\r\nor Miranda. Beauty pure and simple, and the perfect excellence thereof, he\r\nrarely seemed to comprehend.\r", "bookID": "17192"}, {"text": "Yet there is beauty in his designs for the \"Ancient Mariner,\" unreal as\r\nthey are, and a consecutiveness rare in a series by Dore. The Rime afforded\r\nhim a prolonged story, with many shiftings of the scene. In _The Raven_\r\nsound and color preserve their monotone and we have no change of place or\r\noccasion. What is the result? Dore proffers a series of variations upon the\r\ntheme as he conceived it, \"the enigma of death and the hallucination of an\r\ninconsolable soul.\" In some of these drawings his faults are evident;\r\nothers reveal his powerful originality, and the best qualities in which, as\r\na draughtsman, he stood alone. Plainly there was something in common\r\nbetween the working moods of Poe and Dore. This would appear more clearly\r\nhad the latter tried his hand upon the \"Tales of the Grotesque and\r\nArabesque.\" Both resorted often to the elf-land of fantasy and romance. In\r\nmelodramatic feats they both, through their command of the supernatural,\r\navoided the danger-line between the ideal and the absurd.

His study of other\r\npoets left traces upon his work in turns of phrase or turns of thought:\r\nShakespeare permeated his whole being, and his influence is to be\r\ndetected not in a resemblance of style, for Shakespeare can have no\r\nimitators, but in a broadening view of life, and increased humanity.\r", "bookID": "23684"}, {"text": "No poet could have owed his education more completely to the English\r\npoets than did John Keats.

On their\r\nreturn they went north as far as Argyleshire, whence they sailed to\r\nStaffa and saw Fingal's cave, which, Keats wrote, 'for solemnity and\r\ngrandeur far surpasses the finest Cathedral.'

Miss Fanny Brawne returned his love, but she\r\nseems never to have understood his nature or his needs. High-spirited\r\nand fond of pleasure she did not apparently allow the thought of her\r\ninvalid lover to interfere much with her enjoyment of life. She would\r\nnot, however, abandon her engagement, and she probably gave him all\r\nwhich it was in her nature to give.

As\r\nKeats never knew what was coming it was quite impossible that the\r\ncharacters should be adequately conceived, or that the drama should be a\r\nunited whole. Nevertheless there is much that is beautiful and promising\r\nin it. It should not be forgotten that Keats's 'greatest ambition' was,\r\nin his own words, 'the writing of a few fine plays'; and, with the\r\nincreasing humanity and grasp which his poetry shows, there is no reason\r\nto suppose that, had he lived, he would not have fulfilled it.\r", "bookID": "23684"}, {"text": "At Shanklin, moreover, he had begun to write _Lamia_, and he continued\r\nit at Winchester.

The same independence of spirit which he had shown in\r\nthe publication of _Endymion_ urged him now to abandon a work the style\r\nof which he did not feel to be absolutely his own. The re-cast he wrote\r\nin the form of a vision, calling it _The Fall of Hyperion_, and in so\r\ndoing he added much to his conception of the meaning of the story. In no\r\npoem does he show more of the profoundly philosophic spirit which\r\ncharacterizes many of his letters.

I went\r\ntowards him: he was examining a single drop of blood upon the sheet.\r\n\"Bring me the candle, Brown, and let me see this blood.\" After regarding\r\nit steadfastly he looked up in my face with a calmness of expression\r\nthat I can never forget, and said, \"I know the colour of that blood;--it\r\nis arterial blood; I cannot be deceived in that colour; that drop of\r\nblood is my death warrant;--I must die.\"'\r", "bookID": "23684"}, {"text": "Keats was one of the most charming of letter-writers.

In the long journal-letters\r\nwhich he wrote to his brother and sister-in-law in America he is\r\nprobably most fully himself, for there he is with the people who knew\r\nhim best and on whose understanding and sympathy he could rely. But in\r\nnone is the beauty of his character more fully revealed than in those to\r\nhis little sister Fanny, now seventeen years old, and living with their\r\nguardian, Mr. Abbey. He had always been very anxious that they should\r\n'become intimately acquainted, in order', as he says, 'that I may not\r\nonly, as you grow up, love you as my only Sister, but confide in you as\r\nmy dearest friend.' In his most harassing times he continued to write to\r\nher, directing her reading, sympathizing in her childish troubles, and\r\nconstantly thinking of little presents to please her. Her health was to\r\nhim a matter of paramount concern, and in his last letters to her we\r\nfind him reiterating warnings to take care of herself--'You must be\r\ncareful always to wear warm clothing not only in Frost but in a\r\nThaw.'--'Be careful to let no fretting injure your health as I have\r\nsuffered it--health is the greatest of blessings--with _health_ and\r\n_hope_ we should be content to live, and so you will find as you grow\r\nolder.'

But Keats was past caring much for poetic fame. He dragged\r\non through the summer, with rallies and relapses, tormented above all by\r\nthe thought that death would separate him from the woman he loved.

One may add that a\r\ncombat would have been completely alien to the whole idea of the poem as\r\nKeats conceived it, and as, in fact, it is universally interpreted from\r\nthe speech of Oceanus in the second book.

We could drop them.\r\n    Only--there was the bonnet in the pew.\r\n    Such a phrase couldn't have meant much to her.\r\n    But suppose she had missed it from the Creed\r\n    As a child misses the unsaid Good-night,\r\n    And falls asleep with heartache--how should I feel?\r\n    I'm just as glad she made me keep hands off,\r\n    For, dear me, why abandon a belief\r\n    Merely because it ceases to be true.\r\n    Cling to it long enough, and not a doubt\r\n    It will turn true again, for so it goes.\r\n    Most of the change we think we see in life\r\n    Is due to truths being in and out of favour.\r\n    As I sit here, and oftentimes, I wish\r\n    I could be monarch of a desert land\r\n    I could devote and dedicate forever\r\n    To the truths we keep coming back and back to.\r\n    So desert it would have to be, so walled\r\n    By mountain ranges half in summer snow,\r\n    No one would covet it or think it worth\r\n    The pains of conquering to force change on.\r\n    Scattered oases where men dwelt, but mostly\r\n    Sand dunes held loosely in tamarisk\r\n    Blown over and over themselves in idleness.\r\n    Sand grains should sugar in the natal dew\r\n    The babe born to the desert, the sand storm\r\n    Retard mid-waste my cowering caravans--\r\n    \"There are bees in this wall.\" He struck the clapboards,\r\n    Fierce heads looked out; small bodies pivoted.\r\n    We rose to go.

He thinks I'll be all right\r\n    With doctoring. But it's not medicine--\r\n    Lowe is the only doctor's dared to say so--\r\n    It's rest I want--there, I have said it out--\r\n    From cooking meals for hungry hired men\r\n    And washing dishes after them--from doing\r\n    Things over and over that just won't stay done.\r\n    By good rights I ought not to have so much\r\n    Put on me, but there seems no other way.\r\n    Len says one steady pull more ought to do it.\r\n    He says the best way out is always through.\r\n    And I agree to that, or in so far\r\n    As that I can see no way out but through--\r\n    Leastways for me--and then they'll be convinced.\r\n    It's not that Len don't want the best for me.\r\n    It was his plan our moving over in\r\n    Beside the lake from where that day I showed you\r\n    We used to live--ten miles from anywhere.\r\n    We didn't change without some sacrifice,\r\n    But Len went at it to make up the loss.\r\n    His work's a man's, of course, from sun to sun,\r\n    But he works when he works as hard as I do--\r\n    Though there's small profit in comparisons.\r\n    (Women and men will make them all the same.)\r\n    But work ain't all. Len undertakes too much.\r\n    He's into everything in town. This year\r\n    It's highways, and he's got too many men\r\n    Around him to look after that make waste.\r\n    They take advantage of him shamefully,\r\n    And proud, too, of themselves for doing so.\r\n    We have four here to board, great good-for-nothings,\r\n    Sprawling about the kitchen with their talk\r\n    While I fry their bacon. Much they care!\r\n    No more put out in what they do or say\r\n    Than if I wasn't in the room at all.\r\n    Coming and going all the time, they are:\r\n    I don't learn what their names are, let alone\r\n    Their characters, or whether they are safe\r\n    To have inside the house with doors unlocked.\r\n    I'm not afraid of them, though, if they're not\r\n    Afraid of me. There's two can play at that.\r\n    I have my fancies: it runs in the family.\r\n    My father's brother wasn't right. They kept him\r\n    Locked up for years back there at the old farm.\r\n    I've been away once--yes, I've been away.\r\n    The State Asylum. I was prejudiced;\r\n    I wouldn't have sent anyone of mine there;\r\n    You know the old idea--the only asylum\r\n    Was the poorhouse, and those who could afford,\r\n    Rather than send their folks to such a place,\r\n    Kept them at home; and it does seem more human.\r\n    But it's not so: the place is the asylum.\r\n    There they have every means proper to do with,\r\n    And you aren't darkening other people's lives--\r\n    Worse than no good to them, and they no good\r\n    To you in your condition; you can't know\r\n    Affection or the want of it in that state.\r\n    I've heard too much of the old-fashioned way.\r\n    My father's brother, he went mad quite young.\r\n    Some thought he had been bitten by a dog,\r\n    Because his violence took on the form\r\n    Of carrying his pillow in his teeth;\r\n    But it's more likely he was crossed in love,\r\n    Or so the story goes. It was some girl.\r\n    Anyway all he talked about was love.\r\n    They soon saw he would do someone a mischief\r\n    If he wa'n't kept strict watch of, and it ended\r\n    In father's building him a sort of cage,\r\n    Or room within a room, of hickory poles,\r\n    Like stanchions in the barn, from floor to ceiling,--\r\n    A narrow passage all the way around.\r\n    Anything they put in for furniture\r\n    He'd tear to pieces, even a bed to lie on.\r\n    So they made the place comfortable with straw,\r\n    Like a beast's stall, to ease their consciences.\r\n    Of course they had to feed him without dishes.\r\n    They tried to keep him clothed, but he paraded\r\n    With his clothes on his arm--all of his clothes.\r\n    Cruel--it sounds. I 'spose they did the best\r\n    They knew. And just when he was at the height,\r\n    Father and mother married, and mother came,\r\n    A bride, to help take care of such a creature,\r\n    And accommodate her young life to his.\r\n    That was what marrying father meant to her.\r\n    She had to lie and hear love things made dreadful\r\n    By his shouts in the night. He'd shout and shout\r\n    Until the strength was shouted out of him,\r\n    And his voice died down slowly from exhaustion.\r\n    He'd pull his bars apart like bow and bow-string,\r\n    And let them go and make them twang until\r\n    His hands had worn them smooth as any ox-bow.\r\n    And then he'd crow as if he thought that child's play--\r\n    The only fun he had. I've heard them say, though,\r\n    They found a way to put a stop to it.\r\n    He was before my time--I never saw him;\r\n    But the pen stayed exactly as it was\r\n    There in the upper chamber in the ell,\r\n    A sort of catch-all full of attic clutter.\r\n    I often think of the smooth hickory bars.\r\n    It got so I would say--you know, half fooling--\r\n    \"It's time I took my turn upstairs in jail\"--\r\n    Just as you will till it becomes a habit.\r\n    No wonder I was glad to get away.\r\n    Mind you, I waited till Len said the word.\r\n    I didn't want the blame if things went wrong.\r\n    I was glad though, no end, when we moved out,\r\n    And I looked to be happy, and I was,\r\n    As I said, for a while--but I don't know!\r\n    Somehow the change wore out like a prescription.\r\n    And there's more to it than just window-views\r\n    And living by a lake. I'm past such help--\r\n    Unless Len took the notion, which he won't,\r\n    And I won't ask him--it's not sure enough.\r\n    I 'spose I've got to go the road I'm going:\r\n    Other folks have to, and why shouldn't I?\r\n    I almost think if I could do like you,\r\n    Drop everything and live out on the ground--\r\n    But it might be, come night, I shouldn't like it,\r\n    Or a long rain.

I'm not denying\r\n    He was hard on himself. I couldn't find\r\n    That he kept any hours--not for himself.\r\n    Daylight and lantern-light were one to him:\r\n    I've heard him pounding in the barn all night.\r\n    But what he liked was someone to encourage.\r\n    Them that he couldn't lead he'd get behind\r\n    And drive, the way you can, you know, in mowing--\r\n    Keep at their heels and threaten to mow their legs off.\r\n    I'd seen about enough of his bulling tricks\r\n    (We call that bulling). I'd been watching him.\r\n    So when he paired off with me in the hayfield\r\n    To load the load, thinks I, Look out for trouble.\r\n    I built the load and topped it off; old Sanders\r\n    Combed it down with a rake and says, 'O. K.'\r\n    Everything went well till we reached the barn\r\n    With a big catch to empty in a bay.\r\n    You understand that meant the easy job\r\n    For the man up on top of throwing down\r\n    The hay and rolling it off wholesale,\r\n    Where on a mow it would have been slow lifting.\r\n    You wouldn't think a fellow'd need much urging\r\n    Under these circumstances, would you now?\r\n    But the old fool seizes his fork in both hands,\r\n    And looking up bewhiskered out of the pit,\r\n    Shouts like an army captain, 'Let her come!'\r\n    Thinks I, D'ye mean it? 'What was that you said?'\r\n    I asked out loud, so's there'd be no mistake,\r\n    'Did you say, Let her come?' 'Yes, let her come.'\r\n    He said it over, but he said it softer.\r\n    Never you say a thing like that to a man,\r\n    Not if he values what he is. God, I'd as soon\r\n    Murdered him as left out his middle name.\r\n    I'd built the load and knew right where to find it.\r\n    Two or three forkfuls I picked lightly round for\r\n    Like meditating, and then I just dug in\r\n    And dumped the rackful on him in ten lots.\r\n    I looked over the side once in the dust\r\n    And caught sight of him treading-water-like,\r\n    Keeping his head above.

Not a rustle.\r\n    I guess they thought I'd spiked him in the temple\r\n    Before I buried him, or I couldn't have managed.\r\n    They excavated more. 'Go keep his wife\r\n    Out of the barn.' Someone looked in a window,\r\n    And curse me if he wasn't in the kitchen\r\n    Slumped way down in a chair, with both his feet\r\n    Stuck in the oven, the hottest day that summer.\r\n    He looked so clean disgusted from behind\r\n    There was no one that dared to stir him up,\r\n    Or let him know that he was being looked at.\r\n    Apparently I hadn't buried him\r\n    (I may have knocked him down); but my just trying\r\n    To bury him had hurt his dignity.\r\n    He had gone to the house so's not to meet me.\r\n    He kept away from us all afternoon.\r\n    We tended to his hay. We saw him out\r\n    After a while picking peas in his garden:\r\n    He couldn't keep away from doing something.\"\r\n    \"Weren't you relieved to find he wasn't dead?\"\r\n    \"No! and yet I don't know--it's hard to say.\r\n    I went about to kill him fair enough.\"\r\n    \"You took an awkward way.

The day began uncertain,\r\n    With clouds low trailing and moments of rain that misted.\r\n    The young folk held some hope out to each other\r\n    Till well toward noon when the storm settled down\r\n    With a swish in the grass. \"What if the others\r\n    Are there,\" they said. \"It isn't going to rain.\"\r\n    Only one from a farm not far away\r\n    Strolled thither, not expecting he would find\r\n    Anyone else, but out of idleness.\r\n    One, and one other, yes, for there were two.\r\n    The second round the curving hillside road\r\n    Was a girl; and she halted some way off\r\n    To reconnoitre, and then made up her mind\r\n    At least to pass by and see who he was,\r\n    And perhaps hear some word about the weather.\r\n    This was some Stark she didn't know.

They laughed together.\r\n    \"Stark?\" he inquired. \"No matter for the proof.\"\r\n    \"Yes, Stark. And you?\"\r\n    \"I'm Stark.\" He drew his passport.\r\n    \"You know we might not be and still be cousins:\r\n    The town is full of Chases, Lowes, and Baileys,\r\n    All claiming some priority in Starkness.\r\n    My mother was a Lane, yet might have married\r\n    Anyone upon earth and still her children\r\n    Would have been Starks, and doubtless here to-day.\"\r\n    \"You riddle with your genealogy\r\n    Like a Viola.

Ramananda had brought to\r\nNorthern India the religious revival which Ramanuja, the great\r\ntwelfth-century reformer of Brahmanism, had initiated in the\r\nSouth.  This revival was in part a reaction against the\r\nincreasing formalism of the orthodox cult, in part an assertion\r\nof the demands of the heart as against the intense\r\nintellectualism of the Vedanta philosophy, the exaggerated monism\r\nwhich that philosophy proclaimed.  It took in Ramanuja's\r\npreaching the form of an ardent personal devotion to the God\r\nVishnu, as representing the personal aspect of the Divine Nature:\r\nthat mystical \"religion of love\" which everywhere makes its\r\nappearance at a certain level of spiritual culture, and which\r\ncreeds and philosophies are powerless to kill.\r", "bookID": "6519"}, {"text": "Though such a devotion is indigenous in Hinduism, and finds\r\nexpression in many passages of the Bhagavad Gita, there was in\r\nits mediaeval revival a large element of syncretism.  Ramananda,\r\nthrough whom its spirit is said to have reached Kabir, appears to\r\nhave been a man of wide religious culture, and full of missionary\r\nenthusiasm.  Living at the moment in which the impassioned poetry\r\nand deep philosophy of the great Persian mystics, Attar, Sadi,\r\nJalalu'ddin Rumi, and Hafiz, were exercising a powerful influence\r\non the religious thought of India, he dreamed of reconciling this\r\nintense and personal Mohammedan mysticism with the traditional\r\ntheology of Brahmanism.  Some have regarded both these great\r\nreligious leaders as influenced also by Christian thought and\r\nlife: but as this is a point upon which competent authorities\r\nhold widely divergent views, its discussion is not attempted here.\r\nWe may safely assert, however, that in their teachings, two--perhaps\r\nthree--apparently antagonistic streams of intense\r\nspiritual culture met, as Jewish and Hellenistic thought met in\r\nthe early Christian Church: and it is one of the outstanding\r\ncharacteristics of Kabir's genius that he was able in his poems\r\nto fuse them into one.\r", "bookID": "6519"}, {"text": "A great religious reformer, the founder of a sect to which nearly\r\na million northern Hindus still belong, it is yet supremely as a\r\nmystical poet that Kabir lives for us.

A hater of religious exclusivism, and\r\nseeking above all things to initiate men into the liberty of the\r\nchildren of God, his followers have honoured his memory by\r\nre-erecting in a new place the barriers which he laboured to cast\r\ndown.  But his wonderful songs survive, the spontaneous\r\nexpressions of his vision and his love; and it is by these, not\r\nby the didactic teachings associated with his name, that he makes\r\nhis immortal appeal to the heart.  In these poems a wide range of\r\nmystical emotion is brought into play: from the loftiest\r\nabstractions, the most otherworldly passion for the Infinite, to\r\nthe most intimate and personal realization of God, expressed in\r\nhomely metaphors and religious symbols drawn indifferently from\r\nHindu and Mohammedan belief.  It is impossible to say of their\r\nauthor that he was Brahman or Sufi, Vedantist or Vaishnavite.\r\nHe is, as he says himself, \"at once the child of Allah and of Ram.\"\r\nThat Supreme Spirit Whom he knew and adored, and to Whose joyous\r\nfriendship he sought to induct the souls of other men, transcended\r\nwhilst He included all metaphysical categories, all credal\r\ndefinitions; yet each contributed something to the description of\r\nthat Infinite and Simple Totality Who revealed Himself, according\r\nto their measure, to the faithful lovers of all creeds.\r", "bookID": "6519"}, {"text": "Kabir's story is surrounded by contradictory legends, on none of\r\nwhich reliance can be placed.  Some of these emanate from a Hindu,\r\nsome from a Mohammedan source, and claim him by turns as a Sufi\r\nand a Brahman saint.  His name, however, is practically a\r\nconclusive proof of Moslem ancestry: and the most probable tale is\r\nthat which represents him as the actual or adopted child of a\r\nMohammedan weaver of Benares, the city in which the chief events\r\nof his life took place.\r", "bookID": "6519"}, {"text": "In fifteenth-century Benares the syncretistic tendencies of\r\nBhakti religion had reached full development.  Sufis and Brahmans\r\nappear to have met in disputation: the most spiritual members of\r\nboth creeds frequenting the teachings of Ramananda, whose\r\nreputation was then at its height.  The boy Kabir, in whom the\r\nreligious passion was innate, saw in Ramananda his destined\r\nteacher; but knew how slight were the chances that a Hindu guru\r\nwould accept a Mohammedan as disciple.  He therefore hid upon the\r\nsteps of the river Ganges, where Ramananda was accustomed to\r\nbathe; with the result that the master, coming down to the water,\r\ntrod upon his body unexpectedly, and exclaimed in his\r\nastonishment, \"Ram!  Ram!\"--the name of the incarnation under\r\nwhich he worshipped God.  Kabir then declared that he had\r\nreceived the mantra of initiation from Ramananda's lips, and was\r\nby it admitted to discipleship.  In spite of the protests of\r\northodox Brahmans and Mohammedans, both equally annoyed by this\r\ncontempt of theological landmarks, he persisted in his claim;\r\nthus exhibiting in action that very principle of religious\r\nsynthesis which Ramananda had sought to establish in thought.\r\nRamananda appears to have accepted him, and though Mohammedan\r\nlegends speak of the famous Sufi Pir, Takki of Jhansi, as Kabir's\r\nmaster in later life, the Hindu saint is the only human teacher\r\nto whom in his songs he acknowledges indebtedness.\r", "bookID": "6519"}, {"text": "The little that we know of Kabir's life contradicts many current\r\nideas concerning the Oriental mystic.

He seems\r\nto have remained for years the disciple of Ramananda, joining in\r\nthe theological and philosophical arguments which his master held\r\nwith all the great Mullahs and Brahmans of his day; and to this\r\nsource we may perhaps trace his acquaintance with the terms of\r\nHindu and Sufi philosophy.  He may or may not have submitted to\r\nthe traditional education of the Hindu or the Sufi contemplative:\r\nit is clear, at any rate, that he never adopted the life of the\r\nprofessional ascetic, or retired from the world in order to\r\ndevote himself to bodily mortifications and the exclusive pursuit\r\nof the contemplative life.  Side by side with his interior life\r\nof adoration, its artistic expression in music and words--for he\r\nwas a skilled musician as well as a poet--he lived the sane and\r\ndiligent life of the Oriental craftsman.  All the legends agree\r\non this point: that Kabir was a weaver, a simple and unlettered\r\nman, who earned his living at the loom.  Like Paul the tentmaker,\r\nBoehme the cobbler, Bunyan the tinker, Tersteegen the\r\nribbon-maker, he knew how to combine vision and industry; the\r\nwork of his hands helped rather than hindered the impassioned\r\nmeditation of his heart.  Hating mere bodily austerities, he was\r\nno ascetic, but a married man, the father of a family--a\r\ncircumstance which Hindu legends of the monastic type vainly\r\nattempt to conceal or explain--and it was from out of the heart\r\nof the common life that he sang his rapturous lyrics of divine\r\nlove.  Here his works corroborate the traditional story of his\r\nlife.  Again and again he extols the life of home, the value and\r\nreality of diurnal existence, with its opportunities for love and\r\nrenunciation; pouring contempt--upon the professional sanctity of\r\nthe Yogi, who \"has a great beard and matted locks, and looks like\r\na goat,\" and on all who think it necessary to flee a world\r\npervaded by love, joy, and beauty--the proper theatre of man's\r\nquest--in order to find that One Reality Who has \"spread His form\r\nof love throughout all the world.\" [Footnote: Cf.

The \"simple\r\nunion\" with Divine Reality which he perpetually extolled, as alike\r\nthe duty and the joy of every soul, was independent both of ritual\r\nand of bodily austerities; the God whom he proclaimed was \"neither\r\nin Kaaba nor in Kailash.\"  Those who sought Him needed not to go\r\nfar; for He awaited discovery everywhere, more accessible to \"the\r\nwasherwoman and the carpenter\" than to the self--righteous holy man.\r\n[Footnote: Poems I, II, XLI.]  Therefore the whole apparatus of\r\npiety, Hindu and Moslem alike--the temple and mosque, idol and holy\r\nwater, scriptures and priests--were denounced by this inconveniently\r\nclear-sighted poet as mere substitutes for reality; dead things\r\nintervening between the soul and its love--\r", "bookID": "6519"}, {"text": "/*\r\n  The images are all lifeless, they cannot speak:\r\n    I know, for I have cried aloud to them.\r\n  The Purana and the Koran are mere words:\r\n    lifting up the curtain, I have seen.\r\n*/\r\n[Footnote: Poems XLII, LXV, LXVII.]\r", "bookID": "6519"}, {"text": "This sort of thing cannot be tolerated by any organized church;\r\nand it is not surprising that Kabir, having his head-quarters in\r\nBenares, the very centre of priestly influence, was subjected to\r\nconsiderable persecution.  The well-known legend of the beautiful\r\ncourtesan sent by Brahmans to tempt his virtue, and converted,\r\nlike the Magdalen, by her sudden encounter with the initiate of a\r\nhigher love, pre serves the memory of the fear and dislike with\r\nwhich he was regarded by the ecclesiastical powers.  Once at\r\nleast, after the performance of a supposed miracle of healing, he\r\nwas brought before the Emperor Sikandar Lodi, and charged with\r\nclaiming the possession of divine powers.  But Sikandar Lodi, a\r\nruler of considerable culture, was tolerant of the eccentricities\r\nof saintly persons belonging to his own faith.  Kabir, being of\r\nMohammedan birth, was outside the authority of the Brahmans, and\r\ntechnically classed with the Sufis, to whom great theological\r\nlatitude was allowed.  Therefore, though he was banished in the\r\ninterests of peace from Benares, his life was spared.  This seems\r\nto have happened in 1495, when he was nearly sixty years of age;\r\nit is the last event in his career of which we have definite\r\nknowledge.  Thenceforth he appears to have moved about amongst\r\nvarious cities of northern India, the centre of a group of\r\ndisciples; continuing in exile that life of apostle and poet of\r\nlove to which, as he declares in one of his songs, he was destined\r\n\"from the beginning of time.\"  In 1518, an old man, broken in\r\nhealth, and with hands so feeble that he could no longer make the\r\nmusic which he loved, he died at Maghar near Gorakhpur.\r", "bookID": "6519"}, {"text": "A beautiful legend tells us that after his death his\r\nMohammedan and Hindu disciples disputed the possession of his\r\nbody; which the Mohammedans wished to bury, the Hindus to burn.\r\nAs they argued together, Kabir appeared before them, and told\r\nthem to lift the shroud and look at that which lay beneath.  They\r\ndid so, and found in the place of the corpse a heap of flowers;\r\nhalf of which were buried by the Mohammedans at Maghar, and half\r\ncarried by the Hindus to the holy city of Benares to be\r\nburned--fitting conclusion to a life which had made fragrant the\r\nmost beautiful doctrines of two great creeds.\r", "bookID": "6519"}, {"text": "\r\nThe poetry of mysticism might be defined on the one hand as a\r\ntemperamental reaction to the vision of Reality: on the other, as\r\na form of prophecy.

It is by the simplest\r\nmetaphors, by constant appeals to needs, passions, relations which\r\nall men understand--the bridegroom and bride, the guru and\r\ndisciple, the pilgrim, the farmer, the migrant bird-- that he\r\ndrives home his intense conviction of the reality of the soul's\r\nintercourse with the Transcendent.  There are in his universe no\r\nfences between the \"natural\" and \"supernatural\" worlds; everything\r\nis a part of the creative Play of God, and therefore--even in its\r\nhumblest details--capable of revealing the Player's mind.\r", "bookID": "6519"}, {"text": "This willing acceptance of the here-and-now as a means of\r\nrepresenting supernal realities is a trait common to the greatest\r\nmystics.

The\r\nworks of the great Sufis, and amongst the Christians of Jacopone\r\nda Todi, Ruysbroeck, Boehme, abound in illustrations of this law.\r\nTherefore we must not be surprised to find in Kabir's songs--his\r\ndesperate attempts to communicate his ecstasy and persuade other\r\nmen to share it--a constant juxtaposition of concrete and\r\nmetaphysical language; swift alternations between the most\r\nintensely anthropomorphic, the most subtly philosophical, ways of\r\napprehending man's communion with the Divine.  The need for this\r\nalternation, and its entire naturalness for the mind which\r\nemploys it, is rooted in his concept, or vision, of the Nature of\r\nGod; and unless we make some attempt to grasp this, we shall not\r\ngo far in our understanding of his poems.\r", "bookID": "6519"}, {"text": "Kabir belongs to that small group of supreme mystics--amongst\r\nwhom St.  Augustine, Ruysbroeck, and the Sufi poet Jalalu'ddin\r\nRumi are perhaps the chief--who have achieved that which we might\r\ncall the synthetic vision of God.  These have resolved the\r\nperpetual opposition between the personal and impersonal, the\r\ntranscendent and immanent, static and dynamic aspects of the\r\nDivine Nature; between the Absolute of philosophy and the \"sure\r\ntrue Friend\" of devotional religion.  They have done this, not by\r\ntaking these apparently incompatible concepts one after the\r\nother; but by ascending to a height of spiritual intuition at\r\nwhich they are, as Ruysbroeck said, \"melted and merged in the\r\nUnity,\" and perceived as the completing opposites of a perfect\r\nWhole.  This proceeding entails for them--and both Kabir and\r\nRuysbroeck expressly acknowledge it--a universe of three orders:\r\nBecoming, Being, and that which is \"More than Being,\" i.e., God.\r\n[Footnote: Nos. VII and XLIX.]  God is here felt to be not the\r\nfinal abstraction, but the one actuality.  He inspires, supports,\r\nindeed inhabits, both the durational, conditioned, finite world\r\nof Becoming and the unconditioned, non-successional, infinite\r\nworld of Being; yet utterly transcends them both.  He is the\r\nomnipresent Reality, the \"All-pervading\" within Whom \"the worlds\r\nare being told like beads.\"  In His personal aspect He is the\r\n\"beloved Fakir,\" teaching and companioning each soul.  Considered\r\nas Immanent Spirit, He is \"the Mind within the mind.\"  But all\r\nthese are at best partial aspects of His nature, mutually\r\ncorrective: as the Persons in the Christian doctrine of the\r\nTrinity--to which this theological diagram bears a striking\r\nresemblance--represent different and compensating experiences of\r\nthe Divine Unity within which they are resumed.  As Ruysbroeck\r\ndiscerned a plane of reality upon which \"we can speak no more of\r\nFather, Son, and Holy Spirit, but only of One Being, the very\r\nsubstance of the Divine Persons\"; so Kabir says that \"beyond both\r\nthe limited and the limitless is He, the Pure Being.\"  [Footnote:\r\nNo. VII.]\r", "bookID": "6519"}, {"text": "Brahma, then, is the Ineffable Fact compared with which \"the\r\ndistinction of the Conditioned from the Unconditioned is but a\r\nword\": at once the utterly transcendent One of Absolutist\r\nphilosophy, and the personal Lover of the individual\r\nsoul--\"common to all and special to each,\" as one Christian mystic\r\nhas it.  The need felt by Kabir for both these ways of describing\r\nReality is a proof of the richness and balance of his spiritual\r\nexperience; which neither cosmic nor anthropomorphic symbols,\r\ntaken alone, could express.  More absolute than the Absolute,\r\nmore personal than the human mind, Brahma therefore exceeds\r\nwhilst He includes all the concepts of philosophy, all the\r\npassionate intuitions of the heart.  He is the Great Affirmation,\r\nthe font of energy, the source of life and love, the unique\r\nsatisfaction of desire.  His creative word is the _Om_ or\r\n\"Everlasting Yea.\"  The negative philosophy which strips from the\r\nDivine Nature all Its attributes and defining Him only by that\r\nwhich He is not--reduces Him to an \"Emptiness,\" is abhorrent to\r\nthis most vital of poets.--Brahma, he says, \"may never be found\r\nin abstractions.\"  He is the One Love who Pervades the world.,\r\ndiscerned in His fullness only by the eyes of love; and those who\r\nknow Him thus share, though they may never tell, the joyous and\r\nineffable secret of the universe.

For the\r\nthorough-going monist the soul, in so far as it is real, is\r\nsubstantially identical with God; and the true object of\r\nexistence is the making patent of this latent identity, the\r\nrealization which finds expression in the Vedantist formula \"That\r\nart thou.\"  But Kabir says that Brahma and the creature are \"ever\r\ndistinct, yet ever united\"; that the wise man knows the spiritual\r\nas well as the material world to \"be no more than His footstool.\"\r\n[Footnote: Nos. VII and IX.]  The soul's union with Him is a love\r\nunion, a mutual inhabitation; that essentially dualistic relation\r\nwhich all mystical religion expresses, not a self-mergence which\r\nleaves no place for personality.  This eternal distinction, the\r\nmysterious union-in-separateness of God and the soul, is a\r\nnecessary doctrine of all sane mysticism; for no scheme which\r\nfails to find a place for it can represent more than a fragment of\r\nthat soul's intercourse with the spiritual world.

LIX, LXVII, LXXV, XC, XCI.]  Love is throughout his\r\n\"absolute sole Lord\": the unique source of the more abundant life\r\nwhich he enjoys, and the common factor which unites the finite\r\nand infinite worlds.  All is soaked in love: that love which he\r\ndescribed in almost Johannine language as the \"Form of God.\"\r\nThe whole of creation is the Play of the Eternal Lover; the\r\nliving, changing, growing expression of Brahma's love and joy.\r\nAs these twin passions preside over the generation of human life,\r\nso \"beyond the mists of pleasure and pain\" Kabir finds them\r\ngoverning the creative acts of God.  His manifestation is love;\r\nHis activity is joy.  Creation springs from one glad act of\r\naffirmation: the Everlasting Yea, perpetually uttered within the\r\ndepths of the Divine Nature.  [Footnote: Nos. XVII, XXVI, LXXVI,\r\nLXXXII.]  In accordance with this concept of the universe as a\r\nLove-Game which eternally goes forward, a progressive\r\nmanifestation of Brahma--one of the many notions which he adopted\r\nfrom the common stock of Hindu religious ideas, and illuminated\r\nby his poetic genius--movement, rhythm, perpetual change, forms\r\nan integral part of Kabir's vision of Reality.  Though the\r\nEternal and Absolute is ever present to his consciousness, yet\r\nhis concept of the Divine Nature is essentially dynamic.  It is\r\nby the symbols of motion that he most often tries to convey it to\r\nus: as in his constant reference to dancing, or the strangely\r\nmodern picture of that Eternal Swing of the Universe which is\r\n\"held by the cords of love.\"  [Footnote: No. XVI.]\r", "bookID": "6519"}, {"text": "It is a marked characteristic of mystical literature that the\r\ngreat contemplatives, in their effort to convey to us the nature\r\nof their communion with the supersensuous, are inevitably driven\r\nto employ some form of sensuous imagery: coarse and inaccurate as\r\nthey know such imagery to be, even at the best.  Our normal human\r\nconsciousness is so completely committed to dependence on the\r\nsenses, that the fruits of intuition itself are instinctively\r\nreferred to them.  In that intuition it seems to the mystics that\r\nall the dim cravings and partial apprehensions of sense find\r\nperfect fulfilment.  Hence their constant declaration that they\r\n_see_ the uncreated light, they _hear_ the celestial\r\nmelody, they _taste_ the sweetness of the Lord, they know an\r\nineffable fragrance, they feel the very contact of love.  \"Him\r\nverily seeing and fully feeling, Him spiritually hearing and Him\r\ndelectably smelling and sweetly swallowing,\" as Julian of Norwich\r\nhas it.  In those amongst them who develop psycho-sensorial\r\nautomatisms, these parallels between sense and spirit may present\r\nthemselves to consciousness in the form of hallucinations: as the\r\nlight seen by Suso, the music heard by Rolle, the celestial\r\nperfumes which filled St.  Catherine of Siena's cell, the physical\r\nwounds felt by St.  Francis and St. Teresa.  These are excessive\r\ndramatizations of the symbolism under which the mystic tends\r\ninstinctively to represent his spiritual intuition to the surface\r\nconsciousness.  Here, in the special sense-perception which he\r\nfeels to be most expressive of Reality, his peculiar\r\nidiosyncrasies come out.\r", "bookID": "6519"}, {"text": "Now Kabir, as we might expect in one whose reactions to the\r\nspiritual order were so wide and various, uses by turn all the\r\nsymbols of sense.  He tells us that he has \"seen without sight\"\r\nthe effulgence of Brahma, tasted the divine nectar, felt the\r\necstatic contact of Reality, smelt the fragrance of the heavenly\r\nflowers.  But he was essentially a poet and musician: rhythm and\r\nharmony were to him the garments of beauty and truth.  Hence in\r\nhis lyrics he shows himself to be, like Richard Rolle, above all\r\nthings a musical mystic.  Creation, he says again and again, is\r\nfull of music: it _is_ music.  At the heart of the Universe\r\n\"white music is blossoming\": love weaves the melody, whilst\r\nrenunciation beats the time.  It can be heard in the home as well\r\nas in the heavens; discerned by the ears of common men as well as\r\nby the trained senses of the ascetic.  Moreover, the body of\r\nevery man is a lyre on which Brahma, \"the source of all music,\"\r\nplays.  Everywhere Kabir discerns the \"Unstruck Music of the\r\nInfinite\"--that celestial melody which the angel played to St.\r\nFrancis, that ghostly symphony which filled the soul of Rolle\r\nwith ecstatic joy.  [Footnote: Nos. XVII, XVIII, XXXIX, XLI, LIV,\r\nLXXVI, LXXXIII, LXXXIX, XCVII.]  The one figure which he adopts\r\nfrom the Hindu Pantheon and constantly uses, is that of Krishna\r\nthe Divine Flute Player.  [Footnote: Nos. L, LIII, LXVIII.]  He\r\nsees the supernal music, too, in its visual embodiment, as\r\nrhythmical movement: that mysterious dance of the universe before\r\nthe face of Brahma, which is at once an act of worship and an\r\nexpression of the infinite rapture of the Immanent God.'\r", "bookID": "6519"}, {"text": "Yet in this wide and rapturous vision of the universe Kabir\r\nnever loses touch with diurnal existence, never forgets the\r\ncommon life.  His feet are firmly planted upon earth; his lofty\r\nand passionate apprehensions are perpetually controlled by the\r\nactivity of a sane and vigorous intellect, by the alert\r\ncommonsense so often found in persons of real mystical genius.\r\nThe constant insistence on simplicity and directness, the hatred\r\nof all abstractions and philosophizings,[Footnote: Nos. XXVI,\r\nXXXII, LXXVI] the ruthless criticism of external religion: these\r\nare amongst his most marked characteristics.  God is the Root\r\nwhence all manifestations, \"material\" and \"spiritual,\" alike\r\nproceed; [Footnote: Nos. LXXV, LXXVIII, LXXX, XC.] and God is\r\nthe only need of man--\"happiness shall be yours when you come to\r\nthe Root.\"  [Footnote: No. LXXX.]  Hence to those who keep their\r\neye on the \"one thing needful,\" denominations, creeds, ceremonies,\r\nthe conclusions of philosophy, the disciplines of asceticism, are\r\nmatters of comparative indifference.  They represent merely the\r\ndifferent angles from which the soul may approach that simple\r\nunion with Brahma which is its goal; and are useful only in so\r\nfaras they contribute to this consummation.  So thorough-going is\r\nKabir's eclecticism, that he seems by turns Vedantist and\r\nVaishnavite, Pantheist and Transcendentalist, Brahman and Sufi.\r\nIn the effort to tell the truth about that ineffable apprehension,\r\nso vast and yet so near, which controls his life, he seizes and\r\ntwines together--as he might have woven together contrasting\r\nthreads upon his loom--symbols and ideas drawn from the most\r\nviolent and conflicting philosophies and faiths.  All are needed,\r\nif he is ever to suggest the character of that One whom the\r\nUpanishad called \"the Sun-coloured Being who is beyond this\r\nDarkness\": as all the colours of the spectrum are needed if we\r\nwould demonstrate the simple richness of white light.  In thus\r\nadapting traditional materials to his own use he follows a method\r\ncommon amongst the mystics; who seldom exhibit any special love\r\nfor originality of form.  They will pour their wine into almost\r\nany vessel that comes to hand: generally using by preference--and\r\nlifting to new levels of beauty and significance--the religious or\r\nphilosophic formulae current in their own day.  Thus we find that\r\nsome of Kabir's finest poems have as their subjects the\r\ncommonplaces of Hindu philosophy and religion: the Lila or Sport of\r\nGod, the Ocean of Bliss, the Bird of the Soul, Maya, the Hundred-petalled\r\nLotus, and the \"Formless Form.\"  Many, again, are soaked\r\nin Sufi imagery and feeling.  Others use as their material the\r\nordinary surroundings and incidents of Indian life: the temple bells,\r\nthe ceremony of the lamps, marriage, suttee, pilgrimage, the\r\ncharacters of the seasons; all felt by him in their mystical aspect,\r\nas sacraments of the soul's relation with Brahma.  In many of these\r\na particularly beautiful and intimate feeling for Nature is shown.\r\n[Footnote: Nos. XV, XXIII, LXVII, LXXXVII, XCVII.]\r", "bookID": "6519"}, {"text": "In the collection of songs here translated there will be found\r\nexamples which illustrate nearly every aspect of Kabir's thought,\r\nand all the fluctuations of the mystic's emotion: the ecstasy,\r\nthe despair, the still beatitude, the eager self-devotion, the\r\nflashes of wide illumination, the moments of intimate love.  His\r\nwide and deep vision of the universe, the \"Eternal Sport\" of\r\ncreation (LXXXII), the worlds being \"told like beads\" within the\r\nBeing of God (XIV, XVI, XVII, LXXVI), is here seen balanced by\r\nhis lovely and delicate sense of intimate communion with the\r\nDivine Friend, Lover, Teacher of the soul (X, XI, XXIII, XXXV, LI,\r\nLXXXV, LXXXVI, LXXXVIII, XCII, XCIII; above all, the beautiful\r\npoem XXXIV).  As these apparently paradoxical views of Reality\r\nare resolved in Brahma, so all other opposites are reconciled in\r\nHim: bondage and liberty, love and renunciation, pleasure and pain\r\n(XVII, XXV, XL, LXXIX).  Union with Him is the one thing that\r\nmatters to the soul, its destiny and its need (LI, I, II, LIV, LXX,\r\nLXXIV, XCIII, XCVI); and this union, this discovery of God, is the\r\nsimplest and most natural of all things, if we would but grasp it\r\n(XLI, XLVI, LVI, LXXII, LXXVI, LXXVIII, XCVII).  The union, however,\r\nis brought about by love, not by knowledge or ceremonial observances\r\n(XXXVIII, LIV, LV, LIX, XCI); and the apprehension which that union\r\nconfers is ineffable--\"neither This nor That,\" as Ruysbroeck has it\r\n(IX, XLVI, LXXVI).  Real worship and communion is in Spirit and in\r\nTruth (XL, XLI, LVI, LXIII, LXV, LXX), therefore idolatry is an\r\ninsult to the Divine Lover (XLII, LXIX) and the devices of\r\nprofessional sanctity are useless apart from charity and purity\r\nof soul (LIV, LXV, LXVI).  Since all things, and especially the\r\nheart of man, are God-inhabited, God-possessed (XXVI, LVI, LXXVI,\r\nLXXXIX, XCVII), He may best be found in the here-and-now: in the\r\nnormal.  human, bodily existence, the \"mud\" of material life (III,\r\nIV, VI, XXI, XXXIX, XL, XLIII, XLVIII, LXXII).  \"We can reach the\r\ngoal without crossing the road\" (LXXVI)--not the cloister but the\r\nhome is the proper theatre of man's efforts: and if he cannot find\r\nGod there, he need not hope for success by going farther afield.\r\n\"In the home is reality.\"  There love and detachment, bondage and\r\nfreedom, joy and pain play by turns upon the soul; and it is from\r\ntheir conflict that the Unstruck Music of the Infinite proceeds.\r\nKabir says: \"None but Brahma can evoke its melodies.\"\r", "bookID": "6519"}, {"text": "\"This version of Kabir's songs is chiefly the work of\r\nMr. Rabindranath Tagore, the trend of whose mystical genius makes\r\nhim--as all who read these poems will see--a peculiarly\r\nsympathetic interpreter of Kabir's vision and thought.  It has\r\nbeen based upon the printed Hindi text with Bengali translation\r\nof Mr. Kshiti Mohan Sen; who has gathered from many sources--sometimes\r\nfrom books and manuscripts, sometimes from the lips of\r\nwandering ascetics and minstrels--a large collection of poems\r\nand hymns to which Kabir's name is attached, and carefully\r\nsifted the authentic songs from the many spurious works now\r\nattributed to him.

Her nature proved here too\r\nstrong for her fortitude. Every morning when she woke, the vision of\r\nhome and the moors rushed on her, and darkened and saddened the day that\r\nlay before her.

As a creative and inventive singer, he surpasses all his rivals\r\nin quantity of good work; in quality of spontaneous instinct and\r\nmelodious inspiration he reminds us, by frequent and flawless evidence,\r\nwho above all others must beyond all doubt have been his first master\r\nand his first model in lyric poetry--the author of \"The Passionate\r\nShepherd to his Love\".\r", "bookID": "22421"}, {"text": "The last of his line, he is and will probably be always the first in\r\nrank and station of English song-writers. We have only to remember how\r\nrare it is to find a perfect song, good to read and good to sing,\r\ncombining the merits of Coleridge and Shelley with the capabilities of\r\nTommy Moore and Haynes Bayly, to appreciate the unique and\r\nunapproachable excellence of Herrick. The lyrist who wished to be a\r\nbutterfly, the lyrist who fled or flew to a lone vale at the hour\r\n(whatever hour it may be) \"when stars are weeping,\" have left behind\r\nthem such stuff as may be sung, but certainly cannot be read and endured\r\nby any one with an ear for verse. The author of the Ode on France and\r\nthe author of the Ode to the West Wind have left us hardly more than a\r\nsong a-piece which has been found fit for setting to music: and, lovely\r\nas they are, the fame of their authors does not mainly depend on the\r\nsong of Glycine or the song of which Leigh Hunt so justly and so\r\ncritically said that Beaumont and Fletcher never wrote anything of the\r\nkind more lovely. Herrick, of course, lives simply by virtue of his\r\nsongs; his more ambitious or pretentious lyrics are merely magnified and\r\nprolonged and elaborated songs. Elegy or litany, epicede or\r\nepithalamium, his work is always a song-writer's; nothing more, but\r\nnothing less, than the work of the greatest song-writer--as surely as\r\nShakespeare is the greatest dramatist--ever born of English race. The\r\napparent or external variety of his versification is, I should suppose,\r\nincomparable; but by some happy tact or instinct he was too naturally\r\nunambitious to attempt, like Jonson, a flight in the wake of Pindar. He\r\nknew what he could not do: a rare and invaluable gift. Born a blackbird\r\nor a thrush, he did not take himself (or try) to be a nightingale.\r", "bookID": "22421"}, {"text": "It has often been objected that he did mistake himself for a sacred\r\npoet: and it cannot be denied that his sacred verse at its worst is as\r\noffensive as his secular verse at its worst; nor can it be denied that\r\nno severer sentence of condemnation can be passed upon any poet's work.\r\nBut neither Herbert nor Crashaw could have bettered such a divinely\r\nbeautiful triplet as this:--\r", "bookID": "22421"}, {"text": "But even such exquisite touches or tones of colour may be too often\r\nrepeated in fainter shades or more glaring notes of assiduous and facile\r\nreiteration. The sturdy student who tackles his Herrick as a schoolboy\r\nis expected to tackle his Horace, in a spirit of pertinacious and stolid\r\nstraightforwardness, will probably find himself before long so nauseated\r\nby the incessant inhalation of spices and flowers, condiments and\r\nkisses, that if a musk-rat had run over the page it could hardly be less\r\nendurable to the physical than it is to the spiritual stomach. The\r\nfantastic and the brutal blemishes which deform and deface the\r\nloveliness of his incomparable genius are hardly so damaging to his fame\r\nas his general monotony of matter and of manner. It was doubtless in\r\norder to relieve this saccharine and \"mellisonant\" monotony that he\r\nthought fit to intersperse these interminable droppings of natural or\r\nartificial perfume with others of the rankest and most intolerable\r\nodour: but a diet of alternate sweetmeats and emetics is for the average\r\nof eaters and drinkers no less unpalatable than unwholesome. It is\r\nuseless and thankless to enlarge on such faults or such defects, as it\r\nwould be useless and senseless to ignore. But how to enlarge, to\r\nexpatiate, to insist on the charm of Herrick at his best--a charm so\r\nincomparable and so inimitable that even English poetry can boast of\r\nnothing quite like it or worthy to be named after it--the most\r\nappreciative reader will be the slowest to affirm or imagine that he can\r\nconjecture. This, however, he will hardly fail to remark: that Herrick,\r\nlike most if not all other lyric poets, is not best known by his best\r\nwork. If we may judge by frequency of quotation or of reference, the\r\nballad of the ride from Ghent to Aix is a far more popular, more\r\ngenerally admired and accredited specimen of Mr. Browning's work than\r\n\"The Last Ride Together\"--and \"The Lost Leader\" than \"The Lost\r\nMistress\". Yet the superiority of the less-popular poem is in either\r\ncase beyond all question or comparison: in depth and in glow of spirit\r\nand of harmony, in truth and charm of thought and word, undeniable and\r\nindescribable. No two men of genius were ever more unlike than the\r\nauthors of \"Paracelsus\" and \"Hesperides\": and yet it is as true of\r\nHerrick as of Browning that his best is not always his best-known work.\r\nEveryone knows the song, \"Gather ye rosebuds while ye may\"; few, I\r\nfear, by comparison, know the yet sweeter and better song, \"Ye have been\r\nfresh and green\". The general monotony of style and motive which\r\nfatigues and irritates his too-persevering reader is here and there\r\nrelieved by a change of key which anticipates the note of a later and\r\nvery different lyric school. The brilliant simplicity and pointed grace\r\nof the three stanzas to [OE]none (\"What conscience, say, is it in thee\")\r\nrecall the lyrists of the Restoration in their cleanlier and happier\r\nmood. And in the very fine epigram headed by the words \"Devotion makes\r\nthe Deity\" he has expressed for once a really high and deep thought in\r\nwords of really noble and severe propriety. His \"Mad Maid's Song,\"\r\nagain, can only be compared with Blake's; which has more of passionate\r\nimagination, if less of pathetic sincerity.\r", "bookID": "22421"}, {"text": "\r\nOf the lives of many poets we know too much; of some few too little.\r\nLovers of Herrick are almost ideally fortunate.

This John's second son,\r\nNicholas, migrated to London, became a goldsmith in Wood Street,\r\nCheapside, and, according to a licence issued by the Bishop of London,\r\nDecember 8, 1582, married Julian, daughter of William Stone, sister of\r\nAnne, wife of Sir Stephen Soame, Lord Mayor of London in 1598. The\r\nmarriage was not unfruitful. A William[A] Herrick was baptized at St.\r\nVedast's, Foster Lane, November 24, 1585; Martha, January 22, 1586;\r\nMercy, December 22, 1586; Thomas, May 7, 1588; Nicholas, April 22, 1589;\r\nAnne, July 26, 1590; and Robert himself, August 24, 1591.\r", "bookID": "22421"}, {"text": "Fifteen months after the poet's birth, on November 7, 1592, Nicholas\r\nHerrick made his will, estimating his property as worth L3000, and\r\ndevising it, as to one-third to his wife, and as to the other two-thirds\r\nto his children in equal shares. In the will he described himself as \"of\r\nperfect memorye in sowle, but sicke in bodye\". Two days after its\r\nexecution he was buried, having died, not from disease, but from a fall\r\nfrom an upper window. His death had so much the appearance of\r\nself-destruction that L220 had to be paid to the High Almoner, Dr.\r\nFletcher, Bishop of Bristol, in satisfaction of his official claim to\r\nthe goods and chattels of suicides. Herrick's biographers have not\r\nfailed to vituperate the Bishop for his avarice, but dues allowed by law\r\nare hardly to be abandoned because a baby of fifteen months is destined\r\nto become a brilliant poet, and no other exceptional circumstances are\r\nalleged.

An\r\nallusion to \"beloved Westminster,\" in his _Tears to Thamesis_, has been\r\ntaken to refer to Westminster school, and alleged as proof that he was\r\neducated there. Dr. Grosart even presses the mention of Richmond,\r\nKingston, and Hampton Court to support a conjecture that Herrick may\r\nhave travelled up and down to school from Hampton. If so, one wonders\r\nwhat his headmaster had to say to the \"soft-smooth virgins, for our\r\nchaste disport\" by whom he was accompanied. But the references in the\r\npoem are surely to his courtier-life in London, and after his father's\r\ndeath the apprenticeship to his uncle in 1607 is the first fact in his\r\nlife of which we can be sure.\r", "bookID": "22421"}, {"text": "In 1607, Herrick was fifteen, and, even if we conjecture that he may\r\nhave been allowed to remain at school some little time after his\r\napprenticeship nominally began, he must have served his uncle for five\r\nor six years. Sir William had himself been bound apprentice in a similar\r\nway to the poet's father, and we have no evidence that he exacted any\r\npremium. At any rate, when in 1614, his nephew, then of age, desired to\r\nleave the business and go to Cambridge, the ten years' apprenticeship\r\ndid not stand in his way, and he entered as a Fellow Commoner at St.\r\nJohn's. His uncle plainly still managed his affairs, for an amusing\r\nseries of fourteen letters has been preserved at Beaumanor, until lately\r\nthe seat of Sir William's descendants, in which the poet asks sometimes\r\nfor payment of a quarterly stipend of L10, sometimes for a formal loan,\r\nsometimes for the help of his avuncular Maecenas. It seems a fair\r\ninference from this variety of requests that, since Herrick's share of\r\nhis father's property could hardly have yielded a yearly income of L40,\r\nhe was allowed to draw on his capital for this sum, but that his uncle\r\nand Lady Herrick occasionally made him small presents, which may account\r\nfor his tone of dependence.\r", "bookID": "22421"}, {"text": "The quarterly stipend was paid through various booksellers, but\r\nirregularly, so that the poor poet was frequently reduced to great\r\nstraits, though L40 a-year (L200 of our money) was no bad allowance.\r\nAfter two years he migrated from St. John's to Trinity Hall, to study\r\nlaw and curtail his expenses. He took his Bachelor's degree from there\r\nin January, 1617, and his Master's in 1620. The fourteen letters show\r\nthat he had prepared himself for University life by cultivating a very\r\nflorid prose style which frequently runs into decasyllabics, perhaps a\r\nresult of a study of the dramatists. Sir William Herrick is sometimes\r\naddressed in them as his most \"careful\" uncle, but at the time of his\r\nmigration the poet speaks of his \"ebbing estate,\" and as late as 1629 he\r\nwas still L10 16s. 9d. in debt to the College Steward. We can thus\r\nhardly imagine that he was possessed of any considerable private income\r\nwhen he returned to London, to live practically on his wits, and a study\r\nof his poems suggests that, the influence of the careful uncle removed,\r\nwhatever capital he possessed was soon likely to vanish.[B] His verses\r\nto the Earl of Pembroke, to Endymion Porter and to others, show that he\r\nwas glad of \"pay\" as well as \"praise,\" but the system of patronage\r\nbrought no discredit with it, and though the absence of any poetical\r\nmention of his uncle suggests that the rich goldsmith was not\r\nwell-pleased with his nephew, with the rest of his well-to-do relations\r\nHerrick seems to have remained on excellent terms.\r", "bookID": "22421"}, {"text": "Besides patrons, such as Pembroke, Westmoreland, Newark, Buckingham,\r\nHerrick had less distinguished friends at Court, Edward Norgate, Jack\r\nCrofts and others.

His eldest brother, Thomas, had been placed\r\nwith a Mr. Massam, a merchant, but as early as 1610 had retired to live\r\na country life in Leicestershire (see 106). He appears to have married a\r\nwife named Elizabeth, whose loss Herrick laments (see 72). Nicholas, the\r\nnext brother was more adventurous. He had become a merchant trading to\r\nthe Levant, and in this capacity had visited the Holy Land (see 1100).\r\nTo his wife Susanna, daughter of William Salter, Herrick addresses two\r\npoems (522 and 977). There were three sons and four daughters in this\r\nfamily, and Herrick wrote a poem to one of the daughters, Bridget (562),\r\nand an elegy on another, Elizabeth (376). When Mrs. Herrick died the\r\nbulk of her property was left to the Wingfields, but William Herrick\r\nreceived a legacy of L100, with ten pounds apiece to his two children,\r\nand a ring of twenty shillings to his wife. Nicholas and Robert were\r\nonly left twenty-shilling rings, and the administration of the will was\r\nentrusted to William Herrick and the Wingfields. The will may have been\r\nthe result of a family arrangement, and we have no reason to believe\r\nthat the unequal division gave rise to any ill-feeling.

When first civil troubles and\r\nthen civil war cast a shadow over the land, it is not very easy to say\r\nhow he viewed the contending parties. He was devoted to Charles and\r\nHenrietta Maria and the young Prince of Wales, and rejoiced at every\r\nRoyalist success. Many also of his poems breathe the spirit of\r\nunquestioning loyalty, but in others he is less certain of kingly\r\nwisdom. Something, however, must be allowed for his evident habit of\r\nversifying any phrase or epigram which impressed him, and not all his\r\npoems need be regarded as expressions of his personal opinions. But with\r\nwhatever doubts his loyalty was qualified, it was sufficiently obvious\r\nto procure his ejection from his living in 1648; and, making the best of\r\nhis loss, he bade farewell to Dean Prior, shook the dust of \"loathed\r\nDevonshire\" off his feet, and returned gaily to London, where he appears\r\nto have discarded his clerical habit and to have been made abundantly\r\nwelcome by his friends.\r", "bookID": "22421"}, {"text": "Free from the cares of his incumbency, and free also from the restraints\r\nit imposed, Herrick's thoughts turned to the publication of his poems.\r\nAs we have said, in his old Court-days these had found some circulation\r\nin manuscript, and in 1635 one of his fairy poems was printed, probably\r\nwithout his leave (see Appendix). In 1639 his poem (575) _The Apparition\r\nof his Mistress calling him to Elysium_ was licensed at Stationers' Hall\r\nunder the title of _His Mistress' Shade_, and it was included the next\r\nyear in an edition of Shakespeare's Poems (see Notes).

elves it call\r\n    Part pagan, part papistical.\r\n    If unto me all tongues were granted,\r\n    I could not speak the saints here painted.\r\n    Saint Tit, Saint Nit, Saint Is, Saint Itis,\r\n    Who 'gainst Mab's-state placed here right is;\r\n    Saint Will o' th' Wisp, of no great bigness,\r\n    But _alias_ called here _Fatuus ignis_;\r\n    Saint Frip, Saint Trip, Saint Fill, Saint Fillie\r\n    Neither those other saintships will I\r\n    Here go about for to recite\r\n    Their number, almost infinite,\r\n    Which one by one here set down are\r\n    In this most curious calendar.\r\n    First, at the entrance of the gate\r\n    A little puppet-priest doth wait,\r\n    Who squeaks to all the comers there:\r\n    \"_Favour your tongues who enter here;\r\n    Pure hands bring hither without stain._\"\r\n    A second pules: \"_Hence, hence, profane!_\"\r\n    Hard by, i' th' shell of half a nut,\r\n    The holy-water there is put:\r\n    A little brush of squirrel's hairs\r\n    (Composed of odd, not even pairs,)\r\n    Stands in the platter, or close by,\r\n    To purge the fairy family.\r\n    Near to the altar stands the priest,\r\n    There off'ring up the Holy Grist,\r\n    Ducking in mood and perfect tense,\r\n    With (much-good-do-'t him) reverence.\r\n    The altar is not here four-square,\r\n    Nor in a form triangular,\r\n    Nor made of glass, or wood, or stone,\r\n    But of a little transverse bone;\r\n    Which boys and bruckel'd children call\r\n    (Playing for points and pins) cockal.\r\n    Whose linen drapery is a thin\r\n    Subtile and ductile codlin's skin:\r\n    Which o'er the board is smoothly spread\r\n    With little seal-work damasked.\r\n    The fringe that circumbinds it too\r\n    Is spangle-work of trembling dew,\r\n    Which, gently gleaming, makes a show\r\n    Like frost-work glitt'ring on the snow.\r\n    Upon this fetuous board doth stand\r\n    Something for show-bread, and at hand,\r\n    Just in the middle of the altar,\r\n    Upon an end, the fairy-psalter,\r\n    Grac'd with the trout-flies' curious wings,\r\n    Which serve for watchet ribbonings.\r\n    Now, we must know, the elves are led\r\n    Right by the rubric which they read.\r\n    And, if report of them be true,\r\n    They have their text for what they do;\r\n    Aye, and their book of canons too.\r\n    And, as Sir Thomas Parson tells,\r\n    They have their book of articles;\r\n    And, if that fairy-knight not lies,\r\n    They have their book of homilies;\r\n    And other scriptures that design\r\n    A short but righteous discipline.\r\n    The basin stands the board upon\r\n    To take the free oblation:\r\n    A little pin-dust, which they hold\r\n    More precious than we prize our gold\r\n    Which charity they give to many\r\n    Poor of the parish, if there's any.\r\n    Upon the ends of these neat rails,\r\n    Hatch'd with the silver-light of snails,\r\n    The elves in formal manner fix\r\n    Two pure and holy candlesticks:\r\n    In either which a small tall bent\r\n    Burns for the altar's ornament.\r\n    For sanctity they have to these\r\n    Their curious copes and surplices\r\n    Of cleanest cobweb hanging by\r\n    In their religious vestery.\r\n    They have their ash-pans and their brooms\r\n    To purge the chapel and the rooms;\r\n    Their many mumbling Mass-priests here,\r\n    And many a dapper chorister,\r\n    Their ush'ring vergers, here likewise\r\n    Their canons and their chanteries.\r\n    Of cloister-monks they have enow,\r\n    Aye, and their abbey-lubbers too;\r\n    And, if their legend do not lie,\r\n    They much affect the papacy.\r\n    And since the last is dead, there's hope\r\n    _Elf Boniface shall next be pope_.\r\n    They have their cups and chalices;\r\n    Their pardons and indulgences;\r\n    Their beads of nits, bells, books, and wax\r\n    Candles, forsooth, and other knacks;\r\n    Their holy oil, their fasting spittle;\r\n    Their sacred salt here, not a little;\r\n    Dry chips, old shoes, rags, grease and bones;\r\n    Beside their fumigations\r\n    To drive the devil from the cod-piece\r\n    Of the friar (of work an odd piece).\r\n    Many a trifle, too, and trinket,\r\n    And for what use, scarce man would think it.\r\n    Next, then, upon the chanters' side\r\n    An apple's core is hung up dri'd,\r\n    With rattling kernels, which is rung\r\n    To call to morn and even-song.\r\n    The saint to which the most he prays\r\n    And offers incense nights and days,\r\n    The lady of the lobster is,\r\n    Whose foot-pace he doth stroke and kiss;\r\n    And humbly chives of saffron brings\r\n    For his most cheerful offerings.\r\n    When, after these, h'as paid his vows\r\n    He lowly to the altar bows;\r\n    And then he dons the silk-worm's shed,\r\n    Like a Turk's turban on his head,\r\n    And reverently departeth thence,\r\n    Hid in a cloud of frankincense,\r\n    And by the glow-worm's light well guided,\r\n    Goes to the feast that's now provided.\r", "bookID": "22421"}, {"text": "  _Halcyon_, king-fisher.\r\n  _Saint Tit_, etc., see Note.\r\n

According to the Calendars of State Papers\r\nin 1625, it was ordered that, \"forasmuch as his Majesty's letters to the\r\nGrand Signior, the King of Persia, the Emperor of Russia, the Great\r\nMogul, and other remote Princes, had been written, limned, and garnished\r\nwith gold and colours by scriveners abroad, thenceforth they should be\r\nso written, limned, and garnished by Edward Norgate, Clerk of the Signet\r\nin reversion\". Six years later this order was renewed, the \"Kings of\r\nBantam, Macassar, Barbary, Siam, Achine, Fez, and Sus\" being added to\r\nthe previous list, and Norgate being now designated as a Clerk of the\r\nSignet Extraordinary. In the same year, having previously been\r\nBluemantle Pursuivant, he was promoted to be Windsor Herald, in which\r\ncapacity he received numerous fees during the next few years, and was\r\nexcused ship money. He still, however, retained his clerkship, for he\r\nwrites in 1639: \"The poor Office of Arms is fain to blazon the Council\r\nbooks and Signet\". The phrase occurs in a series of nineteen letters of\r\nextraordinary interest, which Norgate wrote from the North, chiefly to\r\nhis friend, Robert Reade, secretary to Windebank, on the course of\r\naffairs. In Sept., 1641, \"Ned Norgate\" was ordered personally to attend\r\nthe king. \"It is his Majesty's pleasure that the master should wait and\r\nnot the men, and _that_ they shall find.\" Henceforth I find no certain\r\nreference to him; according to Fuller he died at the Herald's Office in\r\n1649. It would be interesting if we could be sure that this Edward\r\nNorgate is the same as the one who in 1611 was appointed Tuner of his\r\nMajesty's \"virginals, organs, and other instruments,\" and in 1637\r\nreceived a grant of L140 for the repair of the organ at Hampton Court.\r\nHerrick's love of music makes us expect to find a similar trait in his\r\nfriends.\r", "bookID": "22421"}, {"text": "313. _The Entertainment, or Porch Verse._ The words _Ye wrong the\r\nthreshold-god_ and the allusion to the porch in the Clipsby Crew\r\nEpithalamium (stanza 4) show that there is no reference here (as Brand\r\nthinks, ii. 135) to the old custom of reading part of the marriage\r\nservice at the church door or porch (cp.

J. H. Ward), we have a contemporary account of the Club known as\r\nthe Tityre Tues, which took its name from the first words of Virgil's\r\nfirst _Eclogue_. \"The beginning of December, 1623, there was a great\r\nnumber in London, haunting taverns and other debauched places, who swore\r\nthemselves in a brotherhood and named themselves _Tityre Tues_. The oath\r\nthey gave in this manner: he that was to be sworn did put his dagger\r\ninto a pottle of wine, and held his hand upon the pommel thereof, and\r\nthen was to make oath that he would aid and assist all other of his\r\nfellowship and not disclose their council. There were divers knights,\r\nsome young noblemen and gentlemen of this brotherhood, and they were to\r\nknow one the other by a black bugle which they wore, and their followers\r\nto be known by a blue ribbond. There are discovered of them about 80 or\r\n100 persons, and have been examined by the Privy Council, but nothing\r\ndiscovered of any intent they had. It is said that the king hath given\r\ncommandment that they shall be re-examined.\" In Mennis's _Musarum\r\nDeliciae_ the brotherhood is celebrated in a poem headed \"The Tytre Tues;\r\nor, a Mocke Song.

Another entry shows that the \"Bugle\" mentioned by Yonge was the\r\nbadge of a society originally distinct from the Tityres, which\r\nafterwards joined with it. The date of Herrick's poem is thus fixed as\r\nDecember, 1623/4, and this is confirmed by another sentence in the same\r\npassage in _Yonge's Diary_, in which he says: \"The Jesuits and Papists\r\ndo wonderfully swarm in the city, and rumours lately have been given out\r\nfor firing the Navy and House of Munition, on which are set a double\r\nguard\". The Parliament to which Herrick alludes was actually summoned in\r\nJanuary, 1624, to meet on February 12. Sir Simeon Steward, to whom the\r\npoem is addressed, was of the family of the Stewards of Stantney, in the\r\nIsle of Ely. He was knighted with his father, Mark Steward, in 1603, and\r\nafterwards became a fellow-commoner of Trinity Hall, Cambridge.

The tradition apparently rests on no better basis than\r\nHerrick's Christian name, and of the poems in the issues of the\r\n_Almanack_ which I have seen, it may be said, that, while the worst of\r\nthem, save for some lack of neatness of turn, might conceivably have\r\nbeen by Herrick--on the principle that if Herrick could write some of\r\nhis epigrams, he could write anything--the more ambitious poems it is\r\nquite impossible to attribute to the author of the _Hesperides_. But\r\napart from opinion, the negative evidence is overwhelming. Of the three\r\nearliest issues in the British Museum, 1664, 1667 and 1669 (all in the\r\nannual collections of Almanacs, issued by the Stationers' Company, and\r\nall, it may be noted, bound for Charles II.), I transcribe the\r\ntitle-page of the first. \"Poor Robin. 1664.

The mention of Saffron Walden had apparently\r\nbeen ridiculed, and the author in this year joins in the laugh, and in\r\n1669 omits the paragraph altogether. But what had Herrick at any time to\r\ndo with Saffron Walden, and why should the poet, whose politics, apart\r\nfrom some personal devotion to Charles I., were distinctly moderate, mix\r\nhimself up with an ultra-Cavalier publication? Also, if Herrick be \"Poor\r\nRobin\" we must attribute to him, at least, the greater part of the\r\ntwenty-one \"Poor Robin\" publications, of which Mr. H. Ecroyd Smith gave\r\na list in _Notes and Queries_, 6th series, vii. 321-3, _e.g._, \"Poor\r\nRobin's Perambulation from the Town of Saffron Walden to London\" (1678),\r\n\"The Merrie Exploits of Poor Robin, the Merrie Saddler of Walden,\" etc.\r\nThese have been generally assigned to William Winstanley, the\r\nbarber-poet, on the ground of a supposed similarity of style, and from\r\n\"Poor Robin\" having been written under a portrait of him.

Dr. Ripley of Concord, helped her, and constantly\r\ninvited the boys to the Old Manse, so that the woods and fields along\r\nthe Concord River were first a playground and then the background of the\r\ndreams of their awakening imaginations.\r", "bookID": "12843"}, {"text": "Born in the city, Emerson's young mind first found delight in poems and\r\nclassic prose, to which his instincts led him as naturally as another\r\nboy's would to go fishing, but his vacations in the country supplemented\r\nthese by giving him great and increasing love of nature. In his early\r\npoems classic imagery is woven into pictures of New England woodlands.\r\nEven as a little boy he had the habit of attempting flights of verse,\r\nstimulated by Milton, Pope, or Scott, and he and his mates took pleasure\r\nin declaiming to each other in barns and attics.

And yet it is doubtful whether any man in his class used his time\r\nto better purpose with reference to his after life, for young Emerson's\r\ninstinct led him to wide reading of works, outside the curriculum, that\r\nspoke directly to him. He had already formed the habit of writing in a\r\njournal, not the facts but the thoughts and inspirations of the day;\r\noften, also, good stories or poetical quotations, and scraps of his own\r\nverse.\r", "bookID": "12843"}, {"text": "On graduation from Harvard in the class of 1821, following the\r\ntraditions of his family, Emerson resolved to study to be a minister,\r\nand meantime helped his older brother William in the support of the\r\nfamily by teaching in a school for young ladies in Boston, that the\r\nformer had successfully established. The principal was twenty-one and\r\nthe assistant nineteen years of age. For school-teaching on the usual\r\nlines Emerson was not fitted, and his youth and shyness prevented him\r\nfrom imparting his best gifts to his scholars. Years later, when, in his\r\nage, his old scholars assembled to greet him, he regretted that no hint\r\nhad been brought into the school of what at that very time \"I was\r\nwriting every night in my chamber, my first thoughts on morals and the\r\nbeautiful laws of compensation, and of individual genius, which to\r\nobserve and illustrate have given sweetness to many years of my life.\"\r\nYet many scholars remembered his presence and teaching with pleasure and\r\ngratitude, not only in Boston, but in Chelmsford and Roxbury, for while\r\nhis younger brothers were in college it was necessary that he should\r\nhelp. In these years, as through all his youth, he was loved, spurred on\r\nin his intellectual life, and keenly criticised by his aunt, Mary Moody\r\nEmerson, an eager and wide reader, inspired by religious zeal,\r\nhigh-minded, but eccentric.\r", "bookID": "12843"}, {"text": "The health of the young teacher suffered from too ascetic a life, and\r\nunmistakable danger-signals began to appear, fortunately heeded in time,\r\nbut disappointment and delay resulted, borne, however, with sense and\r\ncourage. His course at the Divinity School in Cambridge was much broken;\r\nnevertheless, in October, 1826, he was \"approbated to preach\" by the\r\nMiddlesex Association of Ministers. A winter at the North at this time\r\nthreatened to prove fatal, so he was sent South by his helpful kinsman,\r\nRev. Samuel Ripley, and passed the winter in Florida with benefit,\r\nworking northward in the spring, preaching in the cities, and resumed\r\nhis studies at Cambridge.\r", "bookID": "12843"}, {"text": "In 1829, Emerson was called by the Second or Old North Church in Boston\r\nto become the associate pastor with Rev. Henry Ware, and soon after,\r\nbecause of his senior's delicate health, was called on to assume the\r\nfull duty. Theological dogmas, such as the Unitarian Church of\r\nChanning's day accepted, did not appeal to Emerson, nor did the\r\nsupernatural in religion in its ordinary acceptation interest him. The\r\nomnipresence of spirit, the dignity of man, the daily miracle of the\r\nuniverse, were what he taught, and while the older members of the\r\ncongregation may have been disquieted that he did not dwell on revealed\r\nreligion, his words reached the young people, stirred thought, and\r\nawakened aspiration. At this time he lived with his mother and his young\r\nwife (Ellen Tucker) in Chardon Street. For three years he ministered to\r\nhis people in Boston. Then having felt the shock of being obliged to\r\nconform to church usage, as stated prayer when the spirit did not move,\r\nand especially the administration of the Communion, he honestly laid his\r\ntroubles before his people, and proposed to them some modification of\r\nthis rite. While they considered his proposition, Emerson went into the\r\nWhite Mountains to weigh his conflicting duties to his church and\r\nconscience. He came down, bravely to meet the refusal of the church to\r\nchange the rite, and in a sermon preached in September, 1832, explained\r\nhis objections to it, and, because he could not honestly administer it,\r\nresigned.\r", "bookID": "12843"}, {"text": "He parted from his people in all kindness, but the wrench was felt.

He soon passed northward, making little stay in\r\nParis, but sought out Carlyle, then hardly recognized, and living in the\r\nlonely hills of the Scottish Border.

His first book,\r\n\"Nature,\" which he was meditating while in Europe, was finished here,\r\nand published in 1836. His practice during all his life in Concord was\r\nto go alone to the woods almost daily, sometimes to wait there for\r\nhours, and, when thus attuned, to receive the message to which he was to\r\ngive voice. Though it might be colored by him in transmission, he held\r\nthat the light was universal.\r", "bookID": "12843"}, {"text": "But he resorted, also, to the books of those who had handed down the\r\noracles truly, and was quick to find the message destined for him. Men,\r\ntoo, he studied eagerly, the humblest and the highest, regretting always\r\nthat the brand of the scholar on him often silenced the men of shop and\r\noffice where he came. He was everywhere a learner, expecting light from\r\nthe youngest and least educated visitor. The thoughts combined with the\r\nflower of his reading were gradually grouped into lectures, and his main\r\noccupation through life was reading these to who would hear, at first in\r\ncourses in Boston, but later all over the country, for the Lyceum sprang\r\nup in New England in these years in every town, and spread westward to\r\nthe new settlements even beyond the Mississippi. His winters were spent\r\nin these rough, but to him interesting journeys, for he loved to watch\r\nthe growth of the Republic in which he had faith, and his summers were\r\nspent in study and writing. These lectures were later severely pruned\r\nand revised, and the best of them gathered into seven volumes of essays\r\nunder different names between 1841 and 1876. The courses in Boston,\r\nwhich at first were given in the Masonic Temple, were always well\r\nattended by earnest and thoughtful people. The young, whether in years\r\nor in spirit, were always and to the end his audience of the spoken or\r\nwritten word. The freedom of the Lyceum platform pleased Emerson.

Of this heresy Emerson said:\r\n\"I deny personality to God because it is too little, not too much.\" He\r\nreally strove to elevate the idea of God. Yet those who were pained or\r\nshocked by his teachings respected Emerson. His lectures were still in\r\ndemand; he was often asked to speak by literary societies at orthodox\r\ncolleges. He preached regularly at East Lexington until 1838, but\r\nthereafter withdrew from the ministerial office. At this time the\r\nprogressive and spiritually minded young people used to meet for\r\ndiscussion and help in Boston, among them George Ripley, Cyrus Bartol,\r\nJames Freeman Clarke, Alcott, Dr. Hedge, Margaret Fuller, and Elizabeth\r\nPeabody. Perhaps from this gathering of friends, which Emerson attended,\r\ncame what is called the Transcendental Movement, two results of which\r\nwere the Brook Farm Community and the Dial magazine, in which last\r\nEmerson took great interest, and was for the time an editor. Many of\r\nthese friends were frequent visitors in Concord. Alcott moved thither\r\nafter the breaking up of his school.

Gray,\r\nin his own notes, has acknowledged certain debts to other poets, and\r\nprobably these were all that he was aware of. Some of these he\r\ncontracted unwittingly (see what he says of one of them in a letter\r\nto Walpole, quoted in the note on the _Ode on the Spring_, 31), and\r\nthe same may have been true of some apparently similar cases pointed\r\nout by modern editors.

His\r\nfather, Philip Gray, an exchange broker and scrivener, was a wealthy\r\nand nominally respectable citizen, but he treated his family with\r\nbrutal severity and neglect, and the poet was altogether indebted for\r\nthe advantages of a learned education to the affectionate care and\r\nindustry of his mother, whose maiden name was Antrobus, and who, in\r\nconjunction with a maiden sister, kept a millinery shop. A brother of\r\nMrs. Gray was assistant to the Master of Eton, and was also a fellow\r\nof Pembroke College, Cambridge. Under his protection the poet was\r\neducated at Eton, and from thence went to Peterhouse, attending\r\ncollege from 1734 to September, 1738. At Eton he had as\r\ncontemporaries Richard West, son of the Lord Chancellor of Ireland,\r\nand Horace Walpole, son of the triumphant Whig minister, Sir Robert\r\nWalpole. West died early in his 26th year, but his genius and virtues\r\nand his sorrows will forever live in the correspondence of his\r\nfriend. In the spring of 1739, Gray was invited by Horace Walpole to\r\naccompany him as travelling companion in a tour through France and\r\nItaly. They made the usual route, and Gray wrote remarks on all he\r\nsaw in Florence, Rome, Naples, etc. His observations on arts and\r\nantiquities, and his sketches of foreign manners, evince his\r\nadmirable taste, learning, and discrimination. Since Milton, no such\r\naccomplished English traveller had visited those classic shores. In\r\ntheir journey through Dauphiny, Gray's attention was strongly\r\narrested by the wild and picturesque site of the Grande Chartreuse,\r\nsurrounded by its dense forest of beech and fir, its enormous\r\nprecipices, cliffs, and cascades. He visited it a second time on his\r\nreturn, and in the album of the mountain convent he wrote his famous\r\nAlcaic Ode. At Reggio the travellers quarrelled and parted. Walpole\r\ntook the whole blame on himself. He was fond of pleasure and\r\namusements, \"intoxicated by vanity, indulgence, and the insolence of\r\nhis situation as a prime minister's son\"--his own confession--while\r\nGray was studious, of a serious disposition, and independent spirit.\r\nThe immediate cause of the rupture is said to have been Walpole's\r\nclandestinely opening, reading, and resealing a letter addressed to\r\nGray, in which he expected to find a confirmation of his suspicions\r\nthat Gray had been writing unfavourably of him to some friends in\r\nEngland. A partial reconciliation was effected about three years\r\nafterwards by the intervention of a lady, and Walpole redeemed his\r\nyouthful error by a life-long sincere admiration and respect for his\r\nfriend. From Reggio Gray proceeded to Venice, and thence travelled\r\nhomewards, attended by a _laquais de voyage_. He arrived in England\r\nin September, 1741, having been absent about two years and a half.\r\nHis father died in November, and it was found that the poet's fortune\r\nwould not enable him to prosecute the study of the law. He therefore\r\nretired to Cambridge, and fixed his residence at the university.\r\nThere he continued for the remainder of his life, with the exception\r\nof about two years spent in London, when the treasures of the British\r\nMuseum were thrown open. At Cambridge he had the range of noble\r\nlibraries. His happiness consisted in study, and he perused with\r\ncritical attention the Greek and Roman poets, philosophers,\r\nhistorians, and orators. Plato and the Anthologia he read and\r\nannotated with great care, as if for publication. He compiled tables\r\nof Greek chronology, added notes to Linnaeus and other naturalists,\r\nwrote geographical disquisitions on Strabo; and, besides being\r\nfamiliar with French and Italian literature, was a zealous\r\narchaeological student, and profoundly versed in architecture,\r\nbotany, painting, and music. In all departments of human learning,\r\nexcept mathematics, he was a master. But it follows that one so\r\nstudious, so critical, and so fastidious, could not be a voluminous\r\nwriter. A few poems include all the original compositions of Gray-\r\n-the quintessence, as it were, of thirty years of ceaseless study and\r\ncontemplation, irradiated by bright and fitful gleams of inspiration.\r\nIn 1742 Gray composed his _Ode to Spring_, his _Ode on a Distant\r\nProspect of Eton College_, and his _Ode to Adversity_--productions\r\nwhich most readers of poetry can repeat from memory. He commenced a\r\ndidactic poem, _On the Alliance of Education and Government_, but\r\nwrote only about a hundred lines. Every reader must regret that this\r\nphilosophical poem is but a fragment. It is in the style and measure\r\nof Dryden, of whom Gray was an ardent admirer and close student. His\r\n_Elegy written in a Country Churchyard_ was completed and published\r\nin 1751. In the form of a sixpenny _brochure_ it circulated rapidly,\r\nfour editions being exhausted the first year. This popularity\r\nsurprised the poet. He said sarcastically that it was owing entirely\r\nto the subject, and that the public would have received it as well if\r\nit had been written in prose. The solemn and affecting nature of the\r\npoem, applicable to all ranks and classes, no doubt aided its sale;\r\nit required high poetic sensibility and a cultivated taste to\r\nappreciate the rapid transitions, the figurative language, and\r\nlyrical magnificence of the odes; but the elegy went home to all\r\nhearts; while its musical harmony, originality, and pathetic train of\r\nsentiment and feeling render it one of the most perfect of English\r\npoems. No vicissitudes of taste or fashion have affected its\r\npopularity. When the original manuscript of the poem was lately\r\n(1854) offered for sale, it brought the almost incredible sum of 131\r\npounds. The two great odes of Gray, _The Progress of Poetry_ and _The\r\nBard_, were published in 1757, and were but coldly received. His\r\nname, however, stood high, and on the death of Cibber, the same year,\r\nhe was offered the laureateship, which he wisely declined. He was\r\nambitious, however, of obtaining the more congenial and dignified\r\nappointment of Professor of Modern History in the University of\r\nCambridge, which fell vacant in 1762, and, by the advice of his\r\nfriends, he made application to Lord Bute, but was unsuccessful. Lord\r\nBute had designed it for the tutor of his son-in-law, Sir James\r\nLowther. No one had heard of the tutor, but the Bute influence was\r\nall-prevailing. In 1765 Gray took a journey into Scotland,\r\npenetrating as far north as Dunkeld and the Pass of Killiecrankie;\r\nand his account of his tour, in letters to his friends, is replete\r\nwith interest and with touches of his peculiar humour and graphic\r\ndescription. One other poem proceeded from his pen. In 1768 the\r\nProfessorship of Modern History was again vacant, and the Duke of\r\nGrafton bestowed it upon Gray. A sum of 400 pounds per annum was thus\r\nadded to his income; but his health was precarious--he had lost it,\r\nhe said, just when he began to be easy in his circumstances. The\r\nnomination of the Duke of Grafton to the office of Chancellor of the\r\nUniversity enabled Gray to acknowledge the favour conferred on\r\nhimself. He thought it better that gratitude should sing than\r\nexpectation, and he honoured his grace's installation with an ode.\r\nSuch occasional productions are seldom happy; but Gray preserved his\r\npoetic dignity and select beauty of expression. He made the founders\r\nof Cambridge, as Mr. Hallam has remarked, \"pass before our eyes like\r\nshadows over a magic glass.\" When the ceremony of the installation\r\nwas over, the poet-professor went on a tour to the lakes of\r\nCumberland and Westmoreland, and few of the beauties of the\r\nlake-country, since so famous, escaped his observation. This was to\r\nbe his last excursion. While at dinner one day in the college-hall he\r\nwas seized with an attack of gout in his stomach, which resisted all\r\nthe powers of medicine, and proved fatal in less than a week. He died\r\non the 30th of July, 1771, and was buried, according to his own\r\ndesire, beside the remains of his mother at Stoke-Pogis, near Slough,\r\nin Buckinghamshire, in a beautiful sequestered village churchyard\r\nthat is supposed to have furnished the scene of his elegy.[1] The\r\nliterary habits and personal peculiarities of Gray are familiar to us\r\nfrom the numerous representations and allusions of his friends. It is\r\neasy to fancy the recluse-poet sitting in his college-chambers in the\r\nold quadrangle of Pembroke Hall. His windows are ornamented with\r\nmignonette and choice flowers in China vases, but outside may be\r\ndiscerned some iron-work intended to be serviceable as a fire-escape,\r\nfor he has a horror of fire. His furniture is neat and select; his\r\nbooks, rather for use than show, are disposed around him. He has a\r\nharpsichord in the room. In the corner of one of the apartments is a\r\ntrunk containing his deceased mother's dresses, carefully folded up\r\nand preserved. His fastidiousness, bordering upon effeminacy, is\r\nvisible in his gait and manner--in his handsome features and small,\r\nwell-dressed person, especially when he walks abroad and sinks the\r\nauthor and hard student in \"the gentleman who sometimes writes for\r\nhis amusement.\" He writes always with a crow-quill, speaks slowly and\r\nsententiously, and shuns the crew of dissonant college revellers, who\r\ncall him \"a prig,\" and seek to annoy him. Long mornings of study, and\r\nnights feverish from ill-health, are spent in those chambers; he is\r\noften listless and in low spirits; yet his natural temper is not\r\ndesponding, and he delights in employment. He has always something to\r\nlearn or to communicate--some sally of humour or quiet stroke of\r\nsatire for his friends and correspondents--some note on natural\r\nhistory to enter in his journal--some passage of Plato to unfold and\r\nillustrate--some golden thought of classic inspiration to inlay on\r\nhis page--some bold image to tone down--some verse to retouch and\r\nharmonize. His life is on the whole innocent and happy, and a feeling\r\nof thankfulness to the Great Giver is breathed over all.\r", "bookID": "30357"}, {"text": "[Footnote 1: A claim has been put up for the churchyard of\r\nGranchester, about two miles from Cambridge, the great bell of St.\r\nMary's serving for the \"curfew.\" But Stoke-Pogis is more likely to\r\nhave been the spot, if any individual locality were indicated. The\r\npoet often visited the village, his aunt and mother residing there,\r\nand his aunt was interred in the churchyard of the place. Gray's\r\nepitaph on his mother is characterized not only by the tenderness\r\nwith which he always regarded her memory, but by his style and cast\r\nof thought. It runs thus: \"Beside her friend and sister here sleep\r\nthe remains of Dorothy Gray, widow, the careful, tender mother of\r\nmany children, one of whom alone had the misfortune to survive her.\r\nShe died March 11, 1753, aged 72.\" She had lived to read the _Elegy_,\r\nwhich was perhaps an ample recompense for her maternal cares and\r\naffection.

The passage in the will reads thus: \"First,\r\nI do desire that my body may be deposited in the vault, made by my\r\ndear mother in the churchyard of Stoke-Pogeis, near Slough in\r\nBuckinghamshire, by her remains, in a coffin of seasoned oak, neither\r\nlined nor covered, and (unless it be inconvenient) I could wish that\r\none of my executors may see me laid in the grave, and distribute\r\namong such honest and industrious poor persons in said parish as he\r\nthinks fit, the sum of ten pounds in charity.\"--_Ed_.]]\r", "bookID": "30357"}, {"text": "Various editions of the collected works of Gray have been published.\r\nThe first, including memoirs of his life and his correspondence,\r\nedited by his friend, the Rev.

Here it was that his _Ode on a Distant Prospect of\r\nEton College_, his celebrated _Elegy written in a Country\r\nChurchyard_, and his _Long Story_ were not only written, but were\r\nmingled with the circumstances and all the tenderest feelings of his\r\nown life.\r", "bookID": "30357"}, {"text": "His mother and aunts lived at an old-fashioned house in a very\r\nretired spot at Stoke, called West-End.

On one side of the house extended an upland field, which\r\nwas planted round so as to give a charming retired walk; and at the\r\nsummit of the field was raised an artificial mound, and upon it was\r\nbuilt a sort of arcade or summer-house, which gave full prospect of\r\nWindsor and Eton. Here Gray used to delight to sit; here he was\r\naccustomed to read and write much; and it is just the place to\r\ninspire the _Ode on Eton College_, which lay in the midst of its fine\r\nlandscape, beautifully in view. The old house inhabited by Gray and\r\nhis mother has just been pulled down, and replaced by an Elizabethan\r\nmansion by the present proprietor, Mr. Penn, of Stoke Park, just\r\nby.[2] The garden, of course, has shared in the change, and now\r\nstands gay with its fountain and its modern greenhouse, and,\r\nexcepting for some fine trees, no longer reminds you of Gray.

The reason of\r\nthis extensive popularity is perhaps to be sought in the fact that it\r\nexpresses in an exquisite manner feelings and thoughts that are\r\nuniversal. In the current of ideas in the _Elegy_ there is perhaps\r\nnothing that is rare, or exceptional, or out of the common way. The\r\nmusings are of the most rational and obvious character possible; it\r\nis difficult to conceive of any one musing under similar\r\ncircumstances who should not muse so; but they are not the less deep\r\nand moving on this account. The mystery of life does not become\r\nclearer, or less solemn and awful, for any amount of contemplation.\r\nSuch inevitable, such everlasting questions as rise on the mind when\r\none lingers in the precincts of Death can never lose their freshness,\r\nnever cease to fascinate and to move. It is with such questions, that\r\nwould have been commonplace long ages since if they could ever be so,\r\nthat the _Elegy_ deals. It deals with them in no lofty philosophical\r\nmanner, but in a simple, humble, unpretentious way, always with the\r\ntruest and the broadest humanity. The poet's thoughts turn to the\r\npoor; he forgets the fine tombs inside the church, and thinks only of\r\nthe 'mouldering heaps' in the churchyard. Hence the problem that\r\nespecially suggests itself is the potential greatness, when they\r\nlived, of the 'rude forefathers' that now lie at his feet. He does\r\nnot, and cannot solve it, though he finds considerations to mitigate\r\nthe sadness it must inspire; but he expresses it in all its awfulness\r\nin the most effective language and with the deepest feeling; and his\r\nexpression of it has become a living part of our language.\"\r", "bookID": "30357"}, {"text": "The writer in the _North American Review_ (vol. 96) from whom we have\r\nelsewhere quoted says of the _Elegy_: \"It is upon this that Gray's\r\nfame as a poet must chiefly rest. By this he will be known forever\r\nalike to the lettered and the unlettered. Many, in future ages, who\r\nmay never have heard of his classic Odes, his various learning, or\r\nhis sparkling letters, will revere him only as the author of the\r\n_Elegy_. For this he will be enshrined through all time in the hearts\r\nof the myriads who shall speak our English tongue. For this his name\r\nwill be held in glad remembrance in the far-off summer isles of the\r\nPacific, and amidst the waste of polar snows. If he had written\r\nnothing else, his place as a leading poet in our language would still\r\nbe assured. Many have asserted, with Johnson, that he was a mere\r\nmechanical poet--one who brought from without, but never found\r\nwithin; that the gift of inspiration was not native to him; that his\r\nimagination was borrowed finery, his fancy tinsel, and his invention\r\nthe world's well-worn jewels; that whatever in his verse was poetic\r\nwas not new, and what was new was not poetic; that he was only an\r\nunworldly dyspeptic, living amid many books, and laboriously delving\r\nfor a lifetime between musty covers, picking out now and then\r\nanother's gems and bits of ore, and fashioning them into\r\nill-compacted mosaics, which he wrongly called his own. To all this\r\nthe _Elegy_ is a sufficient answer. It is not old--it is not bookish;\r\nit is new and human. Books could not make its maker: he was born of\r\nthe divine breath alone. Consider all the commentators, the\r\nscholiasts, the interpreters, the annotators, and other like\r\nbook-worms, from Aristarchus down to Doderlein; and may it not be\r\nsaid that, among them all, 'Nec viget quidquam simile aut secundum?'\r", "bookID": "30357"}, {"text": "\"Gray wrote but little, yet he wrote that little well.

For, suppose that he\r\nhad never written this, but instead had done much else in other ways,\r\naccording to his powers: that he had written many learned treatises;\r\nthat he had, with keen criticism, expounded and reconstructed Greek\r\nclassics; that he had, perchance, sat upon the woolsack, and laid\r\nrich offerings at the feet of blind Justice;--taking the years\r\ntogether, would it have been, on the whole, better for him or for us?\r\nWould he have added so much to the sum of human happiness?

We must also observe how much this moral\r\nfeeling increases as we approach the close; how the poem rises in\r\ndignity; and by what a fine gradation the solemnity of the subject\r\nascends. The Bard commenced his song with feelings of sorrow for his\r\ndeparted brethren and his desolate country. This despondence,\r\nhowever, has given way to emotions of a nobler and more exalted\r\nnature. What can be more magnificent than the vision which opens\r\nbefore him to display the triumph of justice and the final glory of\r\nhis cause?

Besides, we\r\nare certain that a prediction may be very dark before the\r\naccomplishment, and yet so plain afterwards as scarcely to admit a\r\ndoubt in regard to the events suggested. It does not belong to\r\ncritics to give laws to prophets, nor does it fall within the\r\nconfines of any human art to lay down rules for a species of\r\ncomposition so far above art. Thus far, however, we may warrantably\r\nobserve, that when the prophetic style is imitated in poetry, the\r\npiece ought, as much as possible, to possess the character above\r\nmentioned. This character, in my opinion, is possessed in a very\r\neminent degree by Mr. Gray's ode called _The Bard_. It is all\r\ndarkness to one who knows nothing of the English history posterior to\r\nthe reign of Edward the First, and all light to one who is acquainted\r\nwith that history.

If not, what is the reason? Is it\r\nnot plain that the poem contains a predominant element of imagination\r\nand feeling which is absolutely excluded from the proposition? And in\r\nthe same way it may be shown that whenever a man expresses himself\r\nproperly in metre, the subject-matter of his composition belongs to\r\nimagination or feeling; whenever he writes in prose his subject\r\nbelongs to or (if the prose be fiction) intimately resembles matter\r\nof fact. We may decide then with certainty that the sphere of poetry\r\nlies in Imagination, and that the larger the amount of _just_ liberty\r\nthe Imagination enjoys, the better will be the poetry it produces.\r\nBut then a further question arises, and this is the key of the whole\r\nposition, How far does this liberty extend? Is Imagination absolute,\r\nsupreme, and uncontrolled in its own sphere, or is it under the\r\nguidance and government of reason? That its dominion is not universal\r\nis obvious, but of its influence we are all conscious, and there is\r\nno exaggeration in the eloquent words of Pascal:\r", "bookID": "30357"}, {"text": "\"'This mighty power, the perpetual antagonist of reason, which\r\ndelights to show its ascendency by bringing her under its control and\r\ndominion, has created a second nature in man.

And absolute it is, if we are to\r\nbelieve Wordsworth, who defines poetry to be 'the spontaneous\r\noverflow of powerful emotion.' This definition coincides well with\r\nmodern notions on the nature of the art. But how different is the\r\nview if we turn from theory to practice! It would surely be a serious\r\nmistake to describe the noblest poems, like the 'Aeneid' or 'Paradise\r\nLost,' as the product of mere spontaneous emotion. And even in lyric\r\nverse, to which it may be said Wordsworth is specially alluding, we\r\nfind the greatest poets, like Pindar and Simonides, composing their\r\nodes for set occasions like the public games, in honour of persons\r\nwith whom they were but little acquainted, and (most significant fact\r\nof all) in the expectation of receiving liberal rewards. We need not\r\nsay that such considerations detract nothing from the genius of these\r\ngreat poets; but they prove very conclusively that poetry is not what\r\nWordsworth's definition asserts, and what in these days it is too\r\noften assumed to be, the mere gush of unconscious inspiration. The\r\ndefinition of Wordsworth may perhaps suit short lyrics, such as he\r\nwas himself in the habit of composing, but it would be fatal to the\r\nclaims of poetry to rank among the higher arts, for it would exclude\r\nthat quality which, in poetry as in all art, is truly sovereign,\r\nInvention. The poet, no less than the mechanical inventor, excels by\r\nthe exercise of reason, by his knowledge of the required effect, his\r\npower of adapting means to ends, and his skill in availing himself of\r\ncircumstances. Consider for a moment the external difficulties which\r\nrestrict the poet's liberty, and require the most vigorous efforts of\r\nreason to subdue them. To begin with, in order to secure the happy\r\nresult promised by Horace,\r", "bookID": "30357"}, {"text": "he has to take the exact measure of his own powers. How many a poet\r\nhas failed for want of judgment by trespassing on a subject and style\r\nfor which his genius is unfitted! Again, he is confronted by the most\r\nobvious difficulties of language and metre, which limit his freedom\r\nto a degree unknown to the prose-writer. And beyond this, if he\r\nwishes to be read--and a poem without readers is no more than a\r\nmusical instrument without a musician--he has to consider the\r\ncharacter of his audience. He must have all the instinct of an\r\norator, all the intuitive knowledge of the world, as well as all the\r\npractical resource, which are required to gain command over the\r\nhearts of men, and to subdue, by the charms of eloquence, their\r\npassions, their prejudices, and their judgment. To achieve such\r\nresults something more is required than 'the spontaneous overflow of\r\npowerful feeling.'\r", "bookID": "30357"}, {"text": "\"How far Wordsworth's own poetry illustrates his principles we shall\r\nconsider presently; meantime his definition helps us to understand\r\nwhat he meant by Gray's fault of widening the space of separation\r\nbetwixt prose and metrical composition. Neither in respect of the\r\nquantity nor the quality of his verse could Gray's manner of\r\ncomposition be described as spontaneous. Compared with Wordsworth's\r\nnumerous volumes of poetry, the slender volume that contains the\r\npoetry of Gray looks meagre indeed; yet almost every poem in this\r\nsmall collection is a considered work of art. To begin with 'The\r\nBard.' Few readers, we suppose, would rise from this ode without a\r\nsense of its poetical 'effect.' The details may be thought to require\r\ntoo much attention; the allusions, from the nature of the subject,\r\nare, no doubt, difficult; but a feeling of loftiness, of harmony, of\r\nproportion, remains in the mind at the close of the poem, which is\r\nnot likely to pass away. How, then, was this effect produced? First\r\nof all we see that Gray had selected a good subject; his raw\r\nmaterials, so to speak, were poetical. The imagination, unembarrassed\r\nby common associations, breathes freely in its own region, and is\r\ninstinctively elevated as it moves among the great events of the\r\npast, dwelling on the misfortunes of monarchs, the rise of dynasties,\r\nand the splendours of literature. But, in the second place, when he\r\nhas chosen his subject, it is the part of the poet to impress the\r\ngreat ideas derived from it on the feelings and the memory by the\r\ndistinctness of the form under which he presents it; and here\r\npoetical invention first begins to work. By the imaginative fiction\r\nof 'The Bard,' Gray is enabled to cast the whole course of English\r\nhistory into the form of a prophecy, and to excite the patriotic\r\nfeelings of the reader, as Virgil roused the pride of his own\r\ncountrymen by Anchises' forecast of the grandeur of Rome. Finally,\r\nwhen the main design of the poem is thus conceived, observe with what\r\nart all the different parts are made to emphasize the beauty of the\r\ngeneral conception; with what dramatic propriety the calamities of\r\nthe conquering Plantagenet are prophesied by his vanquished foe;\r\nwhile on the other hand, the literary glories of the Tudor Elizabeth\r\nawaken the triumph of the patriot and the poet; how martial and\r\nspirited is the opening of the poem! how lofty and enthusiastic its\r\nclose! Perhaps there is no English lyric which, animated by equal\r\nfervour, displays so much architectural genius as 'The Bard.'\r", "bookID": "30357"}, {"text": "\"Take, again, the 'Ode on the Prospect of Eton College.' A subject\r\nbetter adapted far the indulgence of personal feeling, or for those\r\nsentimental confidences between the reader and the poet, in which the\r\nmodern muse so much delights, could not be imagined. But what do we\r\nfind? The theme is treated in the most general manner. Though\r\nemphasizing the irony of his reflection by the beautiful touch of\r\nmemory in the second stanza, the poet speaks throughout as a moralist\r\nor spectator; from first to last he seems to lose all thought of\r\nhimself in contemplating the tragedies he foresees for others; the\r\nsubject is in fact handled with the most skilful rhetoric, and every\r\nstanza is made to strengthen and elaborate the leading thought. In\r\nthe 'Progress of Poesy,' though the general constructive effect is\r\nperhaps inferior to 'The Bard,' we see the same evidence of careful\r\npreconsideration, while the course of the poem is particularly\r\ndistinguished by the beauty of the transitions. Of the form of the\r\n'Elegy' it is superfluous to speak; a poem so dignified and yet so\r\ntender, appeals immediately, and will continue to appeal, to the\r\nheart of every Englishman, so long as the care of public liberty and\r\nlove of the soil maintain their hold in this country. In this poem,\r\nas indeed in all that Gray ever wrote, we find it his first principle\r\n_to prefer his subject to himself_; he never forgot that while he was\r\na man he was also an artist, and he knew that the function of art was\r\nnot merely to indulge nature, but to dignify and refine it.\r", "bookID": "30357"}, {"text": "\"Yet, in spite of his love of form, there is nothing frigid or\r\nstatuesque in the genius of Gray. A vein of deep melancholy,\r\nevidently constitutional, runs through his poetry, and, considering\r\nhow little he produced, the number of personal allusions in his\r\nverses is undoubtedly large. But he is entirely free from that\r\negotism which we have had frequent occasion to blame as the\r\nprevailing vice of modern poetry. For whereas the modern poet thrusts\r\nhis private feelings into prominence, and finds a luxury in the\r\nconfession of his sorrows, Gray's references to himself are\r\nintroduced on public grounds, or, in other words, with a view to\r\npoetical effect. He, like our own bards, is 'condemned to groan,' but\r\nfor different reasons--\r", "bookID": "30357"}, {"text": "  'Ah, happy hills! ah, pleasing shade!\r\n     Ah, fields belov'd in vain!\r\n   Where once my careless childhood play'd,\r\n     A stranger yet to pain!\r\n   I feel the gales that from ye blow\r\n   A momentary bliss bestow,\r\n     As waving fresh their gladsome wing,\r\n   My weary soul they seem to soothe,\r\n   And, redolent of joy and youth,\r\n     To breathe a second spring.'\r", "bookID": "30357"}, {"text": "Every one will perceive the art which enforces the truth of the\r\ngeneral reflections that follow by the personal experience of the\r\nspeaker.

How just and beautiful is the turn where, after\r\ncontemplating the general lot of the lowly society he is celebrating,\r\nhe proceeds to identify his own fate with theirs:\r", "bookID": "30357"}, {"text": "\"The two great characteristics of Gray's poetry that we have\r\nnoticed--his self-suppression and his sense of form and dignity--are\r\nbest described by the word 'classical.' What we particularly admire\r\nin the great authors of Greece and Rome is their public spirit. Their\r\nwritings are full of patriotism, good-breeding, and common-sense, and\r\nhave that happy mixture of art and nature which is only acquired by\r\nmen who have learned from liberty how to discipline individual\r\ninstincts by social refinement. Their style is masculine, clear, and\r\nmoderate; they seem, as it were, never to lose the sense of being\r\nbefore an audience, and, like orators who know that they are always\r\nexposed to the judgment of their intellectual equals, they aim at\r\nputting intelligible thoughts into the most natural and forcible\r\nwords. Precisely the same qualities are observable in all the best\r\nEnglish writers of the eighteenth century. Addison, Pope, and\r\nGoldsmith are perhaps the most shining examples, but the rest are\r\n'classical' in the sense which we have just indicated; and we can\r\nhardly be wrong in ascribing this common rhetorical instinct to the\r\nintimate connection between the men of thought and the men of action,\r\nwhich existed both in the free states of antiquity, and in England\r\nunder the rule of the aristocracy. With the advance of the eighteenth\r\ncentury the instinct in English literature seems to grow weaker; the\r\nstyle of our authors becomes more formal and constrained, and\r\nsymptoms of that dislike of society encouraged by the philosophy of\r\nRousseau more frequently betray themselves. As the poetry of Cowper\r\nshows less social instinct than that of Gray, so Gray himself is\r\ninferior in this respect to Pope and Goldsmith. But his style has the\r\nsame lofty public spirit that distinguishes his favourite models, and\r\nno worthier form could be imagined to express the ardour excited in\r\nthe heart of a patriotic poet by the rising fortunes of his native\r\ncountry. We feel that it is in every way fitting that the author of\r\nthe 'Elegy' should have been the favourite of Wolfe and the\r\ncountryman of Chatham.\"\r", "bookID": "30357"}, {"text": "Note: Project Gutenberg also has an HTML version of this file which\r\n      includes the original illustrations and music clips as well as\r\n      midi, pdf, and lilypond files.\r\n      See 13649-h.htm or 13649-h.zip:\r\n      (http://www.gutenberg.net/dirs/1/3/6/4/13649/13649-h/13649-h.htm)\r\n      or\r\n      (http://www.gutenberg.net/dirs/1/3/6/4/13649/13649-h.zip)\r", "bookID": "13649"}, {"text": "    LAUGHABLE LYRICS\r\n        THE DONG WITH A LUMINOUS NOSE\r\n        THE TWO OLD BACHELORS\r\n        THE PELICAN CHORUS\r\n        THE YONGHY-BONGHY-Bo\r\n        THE POBBLE WHO HAS NO TOES\r\n        THE NEW VESTMENTS\r\n        MR.
